# Input and Output in Python

## Overview
Input and output operations in Python allow you to interact with users by taking input and displaying results. Python provides built-in functions like `input()` for taking input and `print()` for output.

---

## Input
1. The `input()` function is used to take input from the user.
2. It always returns the input as a string.

### Syntax:
```python
variable = input("Prompt message")
```

### Examples:
#### Basic Input:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

#### Input with Type Conversion:
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You will be " + str(age + 1) + " next year.")
```

---

## Output
1. The `print()` function is used to display output to the user.
2. Supports multiple arguments, formatting, and special characters.

### Syntax:
```python
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n')
```

- `sep`: Specifies the separator between values. Default is a space.
- `end`: Specifies what to print at the end of the output. Default is a newline.

### Examples:
#### Basic Print:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Print Multiple Values:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

#### Custom Separator and End:
```python
print("Python", "is", "fun", sep="-", end="!\n")
```

Output:
```
Python-is-fun!
```

---

## String Formatting
1. You can format output using:
   - Concatenation (`+`)
   - `str.format()` method
   - f-strings (formatted string literals)

### Examples:
#### Concatenation:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + str(age))
```

#### Using `str.format()`:
```python
print("Name: {}, Age: {}".format("Alice", 25))
```

#### Using f-strings:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
```

---

## File Input and Output
1. Python can read from and write to files using built-in file handling functions.

### File Modes:
- `r`: Read (default mode).
- `w`: Write (overwrites file if it exists).
- `a`: Append (adds content to the end of the file).
- `x`: Create (creates a new file; fails if file exists).

### Syntax:
```python
file = open("filename", mode)
file.close()
```

### Examples:
#### Writing to a File:
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

#### Reading from a File:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

#### Appending to a File:
```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nPython is fun!")
```

---

## Special Characters in Strings
1. Use escape sequences for special characters in strings.
2. Common escape sequences:
   - `\n`: Newline
   - `\t`: Tab
   - `\\`: Backslash
   - `\'`: Single quote
   - `\"`: Double quote

### Examples:
```python
print("Hello\nWorld!")  # Output: Hello (newline) World!
print("Tab\tSpace")     # Output: Tab    Space
```

---

## Summary
1. Use `input()` to get user input, optionally converting it to the required type.
2. Use `print()` to display output, with options for formatting.
3. Perform file operations to read from or write to files, using proper file modes.
4. Use string formatting and escape sequences to make your output more dynamic and readable.
