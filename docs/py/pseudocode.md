# Pseudocode in Python

## Overview
Pseudocode is a high-level description of a program's logic that uses plain language to outline the steps of an algorithm. It bridges the gap between human understanding and actual code by focusing on logic without adhering to syntax rules of a programming language.

---

## Why Use Pseudocode?
1. **Simplifies Logic**: Focus on what needs to be done, not how.
2. **Enhances Collaboration**: Non-technical team members can understand the plan.
3. **Improves Planning**: Helps map out the program before coding.
4. **Eases Debugging**: Logical steps are easier to debug and understand.

---

## Guidelines for Writing Pseudocode
1. **Use Simple Language**: Write in clear, plain English.
2. **Focus on Logic**: Avoid language-specific syntax.
3. **Be Structured**: Use indentation for clarity and flow.
4. **Use Keywords**: Incorporate keywords like `IF`, `ELSE`, `WHILE`, `FOR`, etc., for readability.
5. **Describe Steps**: Include enough detail for a programmer to translate into actual code.

## Common Keywords
| Keyword      | Meaning                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `IF`         | Conditional logic                      |
| `ELSE`       | Alternate logic for `IF` conditions    |
| `FOR`        | Iteration through a set of items       |
| `WHILE`      | Repeat as long as a condition is true  |
| `RETURN`     | Provide output from a process          |
| `END`        | End of a block or statement            |

## Example: Basic Pseudocode
### Problem: Find the largest number in a list.

**Pseudocode**:
```
SET max_number TO first item in the list
FOR each number in the list
    IF number > max_number THEN
        SET max_number TO number
    END IF
END FOR
RETURN max_number
```

**Python Code**:
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 25]
max_number = numbers[0]

for number in numbers:
    if number > max_number:
        max_number = number

print(max_number)
```

---

## Translating Pseudocode to Python
### Pseudocode Example 1: Calculate Factorial
```
SET result TO 1
FOR i FROM 1 TO n
    MULTIPLY result BY i
END FOR
RETURN result
```

**Python Code**:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### Pseudocode Example 2: Check if a Number is Prime
```
IF number <= 1 THEN
    RETURN False
END IF
FOR i FROM 2 TO square root of number
    IF number MODULO i IS 0 THEN
        RETURN False
    END IF
END FOR
RETURN True
```

**Python Code**:
```python
import math

def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(number)) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(is_prime(11))  # Output: True
```

## Pseudocode for Common Constructs
### Conditional Statements
**Pseudocode**:
```
IF condition THEN
    Execute block A
ELSE
    Execute block B
END IF
```

**Python Code**:
```python
if condition:
    # Block A
else:
    # Block B
```

### Loops
**FOR Loop Pseudocode**:
```
FOR each item in collection
    Execute block
END FOR
```

**Python Code**:
```python
for item in collection:
    # Block
```

**WHILE Loop Pseudocode**:
```
WHILE condition IS True
    Execute block
END WHILE
```

**Python Code**:
```python
while condition:
    # Block
```

---

## Benefits of Pseudocode
1. **Language Agnostic**: Focuses on logic, not syntax.
2. **Improves Code Quality**: Encourages pre-planning and clear structure.
3. **Simplifies Collaboration**: Easier for teams to brainstorm and align.

---

## Summary
1. Pseudocode is an essential tool for planning and structuring algorithms before implementation.
2. Use simple, clear language and follow logical flow.
3. Translate pseudocode into Python by mapping keywords and logical steps into code constructs.
