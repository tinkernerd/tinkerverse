# Portrait Photography

Portrait photography is all about capturing the essence of your subject. Here are key tips:

- **Lighting**: Use soft, diffused light to flatter your subjectâ€™s features. Window light or a softbox works well for portraits.
- **Focus on the Eyes**: Make sure the eyes are sharp and well-lit, as they are the focal point of any portrait.
- **Background**: Keep the background simple and uncluttered to make the subject stand out.
- **Interaction**: Build rapport with your subject to help them relax and bring out their personality in the shot.

Good portraits combine technical skill with emotional connection.
