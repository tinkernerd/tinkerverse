# Camera Settings

Understanding your camera settings is crucial to taking great photos. Key settings include:

- **Aperture**: Controls the amount of light entering the camera and affects depth of field.
- **Shutter Speed**: Determines how long the camera sensor is exposed to light. A fast shutter speed freezes motion, while a slow shutter speed creates motion blur.
- **ISO**: Controls the camera sensor's sensitivity to light. Lower ISO values produce less noise but require more light, while higher ISO values work better in low-light conditions.
- **White Balance**: Adjusts the color temperature of your photos to match the lighting conditions.

Experimenting with these settings in manual mode can drastically improve your photography.
