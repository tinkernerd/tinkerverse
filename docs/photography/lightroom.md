# Post-Processing in Lightroom

Post-processing can bring out the best in your photos. In Adobe Lightroom, focus on these key adjustments:

- **Exposure**: Adjust overall brightness.
- **Contrast**: Increase contrast for more depth and definition between light and dark areas.
- **White Balance**: Fine-tune color temperature for accurate tones.
- **Sharpening**: Enhance details, but be cautious of over-sharpening, which can introduce noise.
- **Saturation and Vibrance**: Adjust colors for a more vibrant look, without oversaturating the image.

Lightroom is a powerful tool for bringing your creative vision to life.
