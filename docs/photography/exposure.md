# Understanding Exposure

Exposure is the balance of light in a photograph, controlled by three main elements:

- **Aperture**: Affects depth of field and light entering the camera. A wider aperture (lower f-stop) allows more light.
- **Shutter Speed**: Controls how long the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. A faster shutter speed lets in less light but freezes motion.
- **ISO**: Adjusts the camera sensor’s sensitivity to light. A higher ISO brightens the image but may introduce noise.

Understanding these elements and how they interact will help you achieve the perfect exposure in any lighting condition.
