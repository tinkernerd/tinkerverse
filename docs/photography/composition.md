# Composition Techniques

Composition is the art of arranging the elements in your frame. Key techniques include:

- **Rule of Thirds**: Imagine your frame divided into nine equal parts. Place the subject along these lines or their intersections for balance.
- **Leading Lines**: Use natural lines in your scene to guide the viewerâ€™s eye toward the subject.
- **Symmetry and Patterns**: Look for symmetry or repeating patterns to create striking images.
- **Framing**: Use objects in the foreground to frame your subject, adding depth and focus to your photos.

Understanding these techniques will help you create more visually appealing images.
