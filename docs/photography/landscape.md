# Landscape Photography

Capturing landscapes requires patience and attention to detail. Key tips include:

- **Use a Tripod**: For sharp images, especially in low light, use a tripod to stabilize your camera.
- **Shoot in Aperture Priority Mode**: A smaller aperture (higher f-stop) increases depth of field, keeping the entire scene in focus.
- **Golden Hour**: Shoot at dawn or dusk for beautiful, soft lighting.
- **Include Foreground Interest**: Add depth and scale by including elements in the foreground, such as rocks or plants.

Landscape photography is about capturing the beauty of nature in its grandest form.
