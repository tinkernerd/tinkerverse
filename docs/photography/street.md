# Street Photography

Street photography captures the essence of everyday life. Key tips include:

- **Be Discreet**: Use a small, unobtrusive camera and avoid drawing attention to yourself.
- **Timing is Everything**: Capture the decisive moment when action and emotion converge.
- **Composition**: Use leading lines, symmetry, and framing to add structure to your photos.
- **Tell a Story**: Look for interesting characters, interactions, or environments that tell a compelling story.

Street photography thrives on spontaneity and keen observation.
