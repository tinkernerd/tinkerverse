# Air Facts - Weather


One of the really great things about learning to fly is the new relationship you’ll develop with the study of weather. You’ll acquire a knowledge of highs, lows, and fronts and how these phenomena affect weather patterns.


## Review:

1. Many pilots either watch the morning TV shows, browse online or check their favorite aviation app to get an idea of what the synopsis is going to be that day.
    
2. Make a practice to study the weather daily. Decide for yourself if today is a good day to fly or not based on your observations. Later, you can compare your conclusions with the actual results of the day.
    
3. Forecasting, especially forecasting more than a few hours ahead of time, is not an exact science. That's why a real pilot is what you might call a weather geek. We’re always checking the latest forecast and report on our mobile device and comparing it to what we see out the window.
    
4. You can’t learn enough about weather patterns. Keep up with your study of weather even after attaining your Recreational or Private Pilot Certificate.
    
5. Always respect the weather.
