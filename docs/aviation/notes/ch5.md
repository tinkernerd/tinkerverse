## ATC Radar Services

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 1_

In this section we'll give you an overview of the entire ATC system, primarily looking at radar services. We will show you how to best use and benefit from air traffic control.

### Review:

1.    All ATC radar facilities provide, on a workload permitting basis, traffic advisories and limited vectoring to VFR aircraft. To receive this service you have to be able to communicate with the facility, be within radar coverage, and be radar identified.

2.    Factors such as: limitations of radar, frequency congestion, volume of traffic, and controller workload could prevent the ATC controller from providing radar traffic advisories.

3.    The controller has complete discretion and the controller's decision not to provide radar assistance is not subject to question.

4.    Radar assistance and traffic information does not relieve the pilot of the responsibility to see and avoid other traffic.

5.    You should also understand that radar vectors are advisory in nature and do not authorize the pilot to violate federal aviation regulations.

6.    If an assigned heading, altitude, or route might compromise your responsibility, you must inform the controller and request a revised instruction.

7.    Air Route Traffic Control Centers, ARTCC, handle en route IFR traffic in controlled airspace. There are twenty centers in the lower 48 states. Each has jurisdiction of controlled airspace the size of several states.

8.    Each center controls IFR traffic within its own area and coordinates with adjacent centers for the orderly flow of IFR traffic between areas.

9.    Centers are divided into sectors. Each sector controller handles IFR traffic within the sector, and coordinates with the controllers responsible for adjacent sectors.

10.  Radar and automation make it possible for the system to handle the tremendous volume of air traffic.

11.  Flight following is an optional service in Class E airspace provided by ATC to VFR aircraft on a workload permitting basis. When taking part in flight following, the VFR aircraft is radar identified and in communication with a controller.

12.  Flight following allows the controller to provide traffic advisories and other assistance to the VFR aircraft.

13.  Flight following provides the controller with a confirmation of the aircraft's identity, route of flight, and altitude. This allows the controller to provide improved service to IFR traffic in the area as well.

  

14.  Flight following may be requested from an Air Route Traffic Control Center or from a Terminal Radar Approach Control facility.

15.  ARTCC or "Center" frequencies may be found in the chart supplement. TRACON or "Approach" frequencies may be found on the Sectional chart and in the chart supplement.

16.  After establishing contact, the controller will give you radar traffic advisories. Other aircraft will be described in terms of clock position, distance, direction of flight, type of aircraft, and altitude, if known.

17.  When participating in radar traffic advisory service, don't change frequencies until you are told to do so. If you need to leave the frequency for a few minutes to update weather, simply advise the controller of this.

18.  At times, ATC will coordinate your flight following with the next sector and hand you off to a controller on another frequency. At other times, the controller's workload may not allow this direct handoff.

19.  If you hear, "Radar service terminated squawk 1200, frequency change approved," it's the end of your radar traffic advisories. You can call center and request VFR advisories from them. As a VFR pilot, you may also cancel the flight following yourself.

20.  The controller's display can show a wide variety of features, including airport location, runway final approach course and special use airspace. It can also show a weather radar overlay to help controllers vector aircraft around heavy precipitation and thunderstorms.

21.  All of the higher altitude airspace in the lower 48 states is covered by radar. Low altitudes which are distant from a radar site may not be in radar coverage.

22.  You may hear the controller also tell you to "ident". The proper response to this instruction is to activate the ident feature of your transponder after entering the assigned code. This is simply a way of enhancing your radar identification for the controller.

23.  When entering transponder codes, there are certain number combinations that should be avoided. Some squawk codes have been assigned for use during special circumstances.

24.  Some transponder codes are specific to an operation. For instance, 7700 is for emergencies, 7600 is for communications failures, and 7500 indicates to the controller you have been hijacked. Avoid going through these codes when dialing in your code.

25.  Procedures for using the special transponder codes are spelled out in the aeronautical information manual.

  

## Air Facts: Getting to Know You

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 2_

In this section we'll explain why every pilot should know an air traffic controller. It really helps the relationship if you meet and talk with them.

### Review:

1.    Normally, controllers are happy to have you visit their facility in order to understand better what goes on there. You'll need an appointment.

2.    ATC controllers will do everything they can to accommodate any request that you make when flying.

3.    That doesn't mean that you will always get what you request.

4.    Controllers don't say no on general principles; there is always a good reason.

5.    Phone numbers for air traffic facilities can be found online.

6.    When you call, you may get into a scheduled program, or you may be handled on an individual basis.

7.    Sometimes a controller will come to your flying club meeting if invited.

8.    Controllers are people like you. They do their job to the best of their ability. However, if you have a question regarding the way you were handled, call them on the phone after your flight.

  

## Magnetic Compass

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 3_

In this section we'll explain how your magnetic compass functions. It's a required instrument and you'll find it simple in construction.

### Review:

1.    The magnetic compass is usually the only north seeking instrument in training airplanes. Two magnetized needles are mounted under a float with the compass card attached. This assembly is mounted on a pivot which allows the card to tilt up to 18 degrees.

2.    The whole assembly is sealed in a chamber filled with a high grade petroleum distillate to dampen the oscillations of the card, lubricate, and take some weight off the pivot.

3.    Actually, the magnets and compass card remain stationary, while the airplane turns around the compass card.

4.    The magnetic field surrounding the earth has lines of force approximately oriented to the magnetic poles. The South Pole end of the magnetized needles are attracted to the earth's magnetic North Pole.

5.    These lines of magnetic force are parallel to the surface at the magnetic equator and increasingly dip downward until they are vertical at the magnetic poles. This dip is the cause of some of the major compass errors.

6.    During straight-and-level, steady speed, flight the card stays level and doesn't allow the magnetized needles to dip. When turning the airplane, or changing airspeed, the compass card tilts and does not show your real heading.

7.    These turn errors are greatest on a north and a south heading. On northerly headings the compass will lag behind the airplane. On southerly headings the compass will lead the airplane. Lead and lag error is minimal at the magnetic equator and is greatest at the magnetic pole.

8.    In the lower U.S. the error is generally 30 to 35 degrees. Compass turns should be made at a shallow bank to keep the card from locking against the case.

9.    At the beginning of a turn from a northerly heading, the compass will show a turn in the opposite direction – it lags the turn.

10.  This lag error is greatest on a north heading and decreases as the heading approaches either east or west. There is no lag or lead error on headings of east and west.

11.  Continuing the turn to south, after passing through an east heading the compass starts leading the airplane and indicates a heading of about 210 degrees when the airplane is headed south.

12.  The memory device NOSE can help you remember lead and lag. N is for north, O for opposite, S for south and E for exaggerate.

  

13.  When decelerating, the aft end of the compass card is tilted downward. When you are speeding up, the compass card tilts upward. When the compass card is tilted its reading is compromised.

14.  On headings of east and west, acceleration error appears as a turn to the north and deceleration a turn to the south. The memory device ANDS will help you remember the effects of acceleration and deceleration – A - acceleration, N - north, D - deceleration, S

- south.

15.  The error diminishes as headings approach north and south with no acceleration or deceleration error on magnetic north and south headings.

16.  Most training airplanes have a heading indicator – a gyro instrument – which precesses. It should be reset every 15 minutes to the compass indication.

17.  The magnetic compass is self-powered and doesn't need electricity or vacuum to work.

  

## Closer Look: Finding A Smoother Ride

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 4_

Learning to fly “comfortably” should be a priority. Here’s how:

### Review:

1.    Consider the height of haze layer. If you climb out on a typical summer day, you’ll bump along for the first 5,000 feet in hazy air. Then, if you’re paying attention, you’ll notice there’s almost a line in the sky: above is clear blue, below is murky. That’s the top of the haze layer - above it will most likely be smooth air and a nice ride.

2.    Gusty winds almost always translates to turbulence. This is usually the worst within a few thousand feet of the surface

3.    The combination of strong winds or full sun over uneven terrain can create some memorable turbulence, so be alert if your departure or destination airport takes you over rugged terrain.

4.    The next weather phenomena to consider is thermals - the rising columns of air that are created by the sun’s heating of the earth and then the release of that heat back into the atmosphere. Large, flat, dark spaces like parking lots and freshly-plowed fields are the best thermal creators, while wooded areas don’t absorb as much heat.

5.    Whether clouds are cumulus or stratus is a good indicator of the stability of the air aloft. Big, billowing cumulus clouds usually mean there’s some lifting action in the atmosphere, while flat stratus clouds often indicate more stable air.

  

## Performance Charts

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 5_

Airplane performance can be defined as the capability of an airplane to operate effectively while serving a specific purpose. Among the elements of performance are takeoff and landing distances, rate of climb, ceiling, speed, maneuverability, stability, payload, and fuel economy.

### Review:

1.    Airplanes are designed with specific performance goals. This explains the design differences among various types of airplanes.

2.    The density of the atmosphere has a direct bearing on airplane performance. Airplanes perform better when the atmosphere is dense.

3.    Pressure, temperature, and humidity affect the density of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is denser when pressure is high with both temperature and humidity are low. Low pressure, high temperature, and high humidity make the atmosphere less dense.

4.    Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature. If pressure altitude and temperature are known, density altitude can be determined by either using a density altitude chart or an E6B.

5.    If an altimeter is available, simply set the barometric scale to 29.92 inches of mercury and read the pressure altitude.

6.    Before trying to use a performance chart or table for the first time, take a minute to acquaint yourself with it. The density altitude chart has temperature on the horizontal axis – both Fahrenheit and Celsius. The vertical axis of the graph is labeled density altitude.

7.    Close to the top of the chart the lines which slope up from left to right are labeled pressure altitude. Work a few examples.

8.    Standard temperature at sea level is 15 degrees Celsius and the standard lapse rate is about 2 degrees Celsius per thousand feet.

9.    Conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius can be made using the temperature scale.

10.  Electronic calculators have a density altitude function that requires pressure altitude input. This converts indicated altitude to pressure altitude as part of the density altitude function.

11.  For actual flight planning, you'll need to use the charts and tables specifically developed for the airplane you are flying. The data may be in tabular form, graphs, or a combination of tables and charts.

12.  Usually there is a sample problem included. Work this out and others to become familiar with your aircraft.

13.  Takeoff and landing distances are affected by several variables including density altitude, airplane weight, runway slope, runway condition, and wind.

14.  If the wind direction is at an angle to the runway, the amount of the headwind must be determined using either a graph or aviation calculator. Practice a few examples.

  

15.  Working with a graph is easy as long as you remember to enter at the proper point and follow the guide lines up or down to reach the variables involved.

16.  A landing distance chart is similar to the takeoff chart in many ways. Practice the sample problems for each.

17.  Before attempting to land at a short strip, check the distance required for takeoff from that strip.

18.  When working these problems, don't forget to apply any notes that are applicable.

19.  If the variables don't fit the table you can interpolate.

20.  If the conditions of the day make it necessary to calculate the takeoff or landing distance that precisely, wisdom suggests waiting for more favorable conditions of wind, temperature, and pressure.

21.  Keep condition such as temperatures, altitude, and runway lengths in the back of your mind. Know those that are close to the edge of your airplane's capabilities. Establish a conservative envelope for operating the airplane.

22.  Finally, consider the variables that are not factored into performance, for example pilot ability and condition of the airplane.

  

## Air Facts: When Enough’s Not Enough

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 6_

The performance numbers we get for airplanes are based on new airplanes flown by professional test pilots in perfect conditions. There aren't really any margins there. The intelligent use of performance numbers becomes a matter of you developing your own margins.

### Review:

1.    There are no discussions of margins nor are there any guidelines in the pilot's operating handbook regarding them.

2.    You have to devise our own minimum margins based on your experience and the type of airplane you are flying.

3.    For example, the required runway length for airliners is based on a calculated speed called. They must have enough runway to stop at any time before reaching V1.

4.    Furthermore, they must have enough performance after the failure of one engine to continue the takeoff after reaching that speed.

5.    This type of reasoning can apply to us as well – we can say that in light airplanes, on takeoff, we should have enough runway to accelerate to liftoff speed and then be able to stop on the remaining runway.

6.    Some of the distances shown in the handbooks, are pretty much on the short side. Any adverse factor could add substantially to your takeoff run.

7.    You can apply this kind of thinking to landing as well. You want to develop a conservative margin of safety above what the operating handbook lists.

8.    Do the same for fuel range. Rather than consider miles flown till the tanks are dry, think time of flight. Fuel runs out of the tanks on the basis of time not miles flown.

9.    Also, never believe the fuel gauges to determine if you have full fuel – look into each tank. If the airplane was filled on an unlevel surface, with one wing lower than the other, you might be short several gallons.

10. If you are sure they are full, subtract some fuel from the listed capacity for taxi, takeoff, and climb. Then subtract an hours fuel at normal cruise from what is left.

11. You will also want to consider the wind and develop margins to handle it as well. A good way to think of this is to double the forecast headwind or halve the forecast tailwind in case the forecast isn't what it was projected to be.

12.  Remember, the number one cause of accidents in single-engine airplanes is engine failure. And the number one cause of engine failure is fuel exhaustion.

  

## Flying to a Towered Airport

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 7_

Now that we have gotten our feet wet talking to ATC during flight following, let's take some flights into and out of a Class D airport.

### Review:

1.    Many tower controlled airports have Automatic Terminal Information Service. ATIS is the continuous broadcast of recorded noncontrol information such as current weather conditions and NOTAMS.

2.    ATIS is continuously broadcast over a discrete VHF frequency or the voice portion of a local NAVAID.

3.    You should be able to receive the ATIS transmission up to sixty nautical miles from the ATIS site. You should also be able to receive the transmission when on the ground at the ATIS airport.

4.    Listen to the ATIS broadcast prior to arrival or departure from an airport with this system. This will help relieve congestion on approach control, ground control, and local control frequencies. You will simply advise the initial controller the phonetic identification for the broadcast that you listened to.

5.    ATIS information includes the latest METAR, the instrument approach, and the runways in use. Information for arriving VFR aircraft may also be on the ATIS. This could include how far out to contact approach control and the frequency to use.

6.    The ATIS is normally updated near the top hour, but can be updated at any time when a significant change in the weather is observed. A new recording is also made for a change in other information such as runway or the instrument approach in use.

7.    Pilots are expected to monitor the ATIS broadcast before contacting clearance delivery, ground control, tower, or approach control.

8.    ATIS broadcasts are subject to change at any time. To make the system work, pilots have to tell the controller which ATIS was monitored. This is done on initial contact with any of the tower functions.

9.    You may not enter the Class D airspace until you have established radio contact with the controller. This means the controller must acknowledge you with your call sign.

10.  An initial call to ATC by a student pilot should include the words "student pilot" at the end of the transmission. This allows the controller to provide the student with extra assistance. It will also encourage the controller to slow down and have patience with the pilot.

11.  The "student pilot" identification should be added to the initial contact with each subsequent air traffic control station.

12.  Your entry into the traffic pattern at a tower controlled airport may be on any of the four legs. The tower controller will advise his instructions based upon the runway in use and the direction from which you are approaching.

  

13.  At some point, the tower controller will clear you to land. Unless you hear this clearance and confirm it with a read back, do not land.

14.  If you are working on landings at a tower-controlled airport, you may decide to ask the tower for “the option.” When cleared for the option, the controller is giving you permission to make your landing a touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or full stop landing.

15.  Landing clearance at a tower controlled field may include a land and hold short requirement. You may accept the land and hold short clearance provided that you can determine that your aircraft can safely land and stop within the Available Landing Distance.

16.  Available Landing Distance data is published in the special notices section of the chart supplement and in the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publications. Controllers will also provide this data upon request.

17.  If you are a student pilot or are not familiar with land and hold short operations, you should not participate in the program.

18.  You, as the pilot in command, have the final authority to accept or decline any land and hold short clearance. The controller will require a full read back of any accepted land and hold short clearance.

19.  Once you have accepted a Land and Hold Short clearance, you must adhere to it unless an amended clearance is obtained or an emergency occurs. If you are unsure that you will be able to stop prior to the hold short point, initiate a go-around and advise ATC.

20.  If you are unsure that you will be able to stop prior to the hold short point, initiate a go-around and advise ATC. You are responsible for maintaining aircraft separation during a rejected landing.

21.  After landing and reaching taxi speed, you should exit the runway promptly at the first available taxiway or on an ATC instructed taxiway. Do not exit the landing runway onto another runway unless authorized by ATC. Do not stop or reverse course on the runway without ATC approval.

22.  Taxi clear of the runway and bring your aircraft to a stop unless otherwise directed by ATC.

23.  Change to the ground control frequency when advised by the tower. The tower may omit the ground control frequency if the controller believes you will know the frequency.

24.  At slower times, the tower controller may be fulfilling the function of ground control as well. He may have you stay on the tower frequency during taxi operations. Follow his instructions.

25.  After landing and reaching taxi speed, you should exit the runway promptly at the first available taxiway or on an ATC instructed taxiway. Do not exit the landing runway onto another runway unless authorized by ATC. Do not stop or reverse course on the runway without ATC approval.

26.  Obtain your taxi instructions from the ground controller. Read back the instructions and comply with any hold short requirements that you are assigned. Compare the instructions to your taxiway charts and signs that you see after you have completed your read back.

  

27.  When taxiing, you must receive a specific runway crossing clearance to cross or operate on any active, inactive, or closed runway along your route.

28.  When departing from a tower-controlled airport, you should listen to ATIS before making any calls to ATC.

29.  The ATIS broadcast will provide you with necessary wind and altimeter information. It will also provide you with pertinent NOTAMs that may not have been available during your preflight planning and it will give you an idea on the runway to expect for departure.

30.  At less busy tower-controlled airports, typical of a Class D airspace airport, your VFR clearance will be obtained from ground control or the tower.

31.  When ready to taxi onto the movement area of the airport, contact ground control. Advise them where you are located on the airport, what your departure plans are, that you have the appropriate ATIS information, and that you are ready to taxi.

32.  The ground controller will give taxi instructions to a specific point on the airport and may provide you with a clearance. Write down these instructions and read them back to the controller.

33.  You are expected to taxi to the approach end of the runway assigned unless ATC assigns or approves your request for an intersection departure.

34.  Unless told otherwise, monitor ground while performing your before takeoff checks. When ready for takeoff, switch to the tower frequency and call to advise.

35.  Don't call the tower at a busy airport until you are number one for takeoff at your location.

36.  When the tower advises you to "fly or maintain runway heading," this is precisely what the controller means. You are expected to fly or maintain the magnetic heading that corresponds with the extended centerline of the departure runway. Do not apply drift correction in this situation.

37.  If you need to change frequency to open your flight plan before leaving the tower's airspace, contact the controller with this request. He may or may not ask you to report back to his frequency once your flight service communications are complete.

38.  During the normal course of your departure, the tower controller may release you from his frequency, but this is not a requirement. Once you are clear of the tower's airspace, you are free to change to your next frequency.

39.  You might also want to contact the tower controller as you are departing the airspace if you need to obtain a frequency for flight following.

  

## Max Performance Takeoffs and Landings

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 8_

In this section we will investigate short-field and soft-field maximum performance takeoff and landing techniques.

### Review:

1.    Taking off and climbing from fields where the takeoff area is short or the available takeoff area is restricted by obstructions requires that the pilot operate the airplane at the limit of its takeoff performance capabilities.

2.    You must learn to control attitude and airspeed so that takeoff and climb performance results in the shortest ground roll and the steepest angle of climb.

3.    To do this, you must be completely knowledgeable regarding the best angle of climb speed and best rate of climb speed for your airplane.

4.    The best angle of climb speed, VX, is the speed that produces the greatest gain in altitude for a given distance over the ground.

5.    The best rate of climb speed, VY, is the speed that produces the greatest gain in altitude per unit of time.

6.    When making a short-field takeoff, start as close to the beginning of the takeoff area as possible. Set your flaps as recommended by the manufacturer before starting the takeoff roll.

7.    After getting lined up, advance up to allowable or maximum takeoff power before you release the brakes.

8.    During the takeoff roll, adjust the airplane's pitch attitude to provide minimum drag – allowing for the fastest acceleration. As you reach VX, firmly apply back elevator pressure until airborne and maintain that speed until obstacles have been cleared or until reaching at least 50 feet above the ground.

9.    Don't try to pull the airplane off the ground too soon or climb at too steep an angle. This could cause the airplane to settle back to the runway or into obstacles.

10.  Now lower the pitch attitude to attain VY.

11.  At a safe maneuvering altitude, slowly retract the flaps.

12.  The objective of a soft-field takeoff is to get the airplane flying as soon as possible to eliminate the retarding force of soft surfaces like mud, sand, high grass, or snow.

13.  During a soft-field takeoff, you want to get the airplane's weight carrying capability moved from the wheels to the wings as soon as possible. You do this by establishing and maintaining a nose high pitch attitude by use of elevator control as soon as possible during the takeoff roll.

14.  Set your flaps as recommended by the manufacturer prior to starting the takeoff roll. Once you start to taxi keep moving so you don't get bogged down in the soft surface. When lined up for departure, apply takeoff power.

  

15.  As the airplane accelerates, apply enough back elevator pressure to maintain a positive angle of attack and keep the weight off the nose wheel.

16.  In this attitude the airplane will fly itself off the ground – lifting off and flying at a slower airspeed than you are accustomed to. This is due to ground effect.

17.  Roughly, ground effect extends up to a height above the ground equal to your airplane's wingspan.

18.  Once flying, and while just above the ground, slowly lower the pitch attitude and let the airplane accelerate to VX if you have to clear obstacles.

19.  If no obstacles are in the way, accelerate to VY. Don't attempt to fly out of ground effect before reaching a safe airspeed. If you do so, the greater induced drag may cause the airplane to settle back to the ground.

20.  Once you have established VY, and reached a safe maneuvering altitude, then slowly raise the flaps.

21.  A short-field approach and landing, especially over obstacles, presents a unique challenge.

22.  In a short-field landing, you have to use a low speed, power-on type of approach right to touchdown, because you must control the rate of descent and airspeed accurately.

23.  You do this so you touch down at the slowest airspeed to stop in the shortest possible distance.

24.  The use of full flaps is usually recommended. Adjust the power and pitch attitude to maintain the manufacturer's recommended approach speed.

25.  If you are too high, reduce power and lower the pitch to increase the descent without increasing airspeed. If too low, increase power and raise the pitch attitude to slow the rate of descent without lowering airspeed.

26.  Don't get too slow. Adding full power and increasing pitch may only increase the rate of descent. In this case, you are operating on the back side of the power curve.

27.  Touchdown in an attitude that will produce a power-off stall when you reduce the power to idle. Hold the elevator control full back, and firmly apply brakes.

28.  In making a soft-field landing, use flaps as recommended by the airplane's manufacturer. Use the same final approach speed as you did for the short-field landing.

29.  After the round-out, fly the airplane just above the surface. Do this as long as practical so you can be as slow as possible at touchdown.

30.  Once down, hold the airplane in a nose high attitude with full back elevator pressure. This is to help keep the nose-wheel clear of the surface while you slow down. You don't want it to dig in.

31.  Don't use the brakes. In fact, you might have to add power to keep moving and prevent becoming bogged down.

32.  NOTE: When faced with making a short, soft-field takeoff or landing, don't, except under the most dire emergency situation.

  

## Closer Look: ADS-B

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 9_

In this section we will take a closer look at ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast.

### Review:

1.    As part of the FAA’s NextGen initiative to modernize ATC, ADS-B will eventually replace radar as the primary tool for separating aircraft.

2.    A-D-S-B is different from radar in that it does not depend on radar sites actively pinging aircraft as they fly. Instead, aircraft equipped with A-D-S-B self-report their position in a networked environment, so pilots can see the entire air traffic picture around them

3.    ADS-B depends on a network of small antennas to receive aircraft reports and send them back to ATC. These ground stations also transmit weather and traffic information back up to properly-equipped aircraft.

4.    ADS-B Out is a surveillance technology for tracking aircraft--it's what ATC needs to manage traffic. An A-D-S-B Out transmitter reports your aircraft's position, velocity and altitude once per second.

5.    ADS-B In allows an aircraft to receive transmissions from ADS-B ground stations and other aircraft. This is how pilots can get subscription-free weather and traffic in the cockpit.

6.    Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B) is just a fancy name for datalink weather.

7.    Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B) is what the name suggests--datalink traffic.

  

## Federal Aviation Regulations

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 10_

To apply for your private pilot certificate, you must meet the federal aviation regulations concerning aeronautical experience and flight proficiency that apply to cross-country flights.

### Review:

1.    The FARs state that you must receive twenty hours of flight instruction including at least 3 hours of cross-country.

2.    These 3 hours of cross-country training must include at least one night cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles.

3.    You also need 10 hours of solo flight time that includes at least 5 hours of solo

cross-country. Each cross-country flight must have a landing more than 50 nautical miles from the original departure point.

4.    One flight must be at least 150 nautical miles, with full-stop landings at a minimum of 3 points, and at least one segment of 50 nautical miles or more.

5.    An endorsement in your logbook from an authorized flight instructor is necessary to state your competency in cross-country flight.

6.    Before starting a cross-country flight, you will have to plan the flight thoroughly.

7.    To fly VFR in the daytime, you need enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, and to fly after that for at least 30 minutes at normal cruising speed. At night, the time increases to 45 minutes.

8.    Any VFR flight above 3,000 feet AGL must maintain the appropriate altitudes. If you are on a magnetic course of 0 degrees through 179 degrees, you will need to maintain an odd thousand foot altitude plus 500 feet. If you are on a magnetic course of 180 through 359 degrees, you need to maintain an even thousand foot altitude plus 500 feet.

9.    For other rules, review Volume 3, What You Should Know Before You Solo.

10.  Your instructor is the final authority as to when you're ready.

  

## Cloud Formations

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 11_

All changes in weather are due to variations in solar energy received by the different regions on Earth.

### Review:

1.    The amount of solar radiation received depends upon time of day. It will vary for any particular spot with season, and for the globe as a whole with latitude.

2.    Variations in solar radiation create differences in temperature which, in turn, create areas of high and low atmospheric pressure.

3.    During the day the heat received is greater than the heat that's lost in the form of terrestrial radiation. At night the situation is reversed.

4.    Often, fog forms just after sunrise, as the coldest temperature is approached.

5.    During the afternoon, the maximum daily temperature occurs several hours after the sun is directly overhead.

6.    Seasonal variations of solar radiation occur because the axis of earth tilts to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun and the axis always points in the same direction.

7.    For example, during June, July, and August the sun is higher in the sky in the northern hemisphere making it warmer than the southern hemisphere due to the more intense sunshine.

8.    There is a temperature gradient from warm equator to cold poles which drives the weather machine.

9.    Because water has a tremendous capacity to absorb heat, large water bodies heat and cool more slowly than the adjacent land areas. As a result, temperature variations near the water are much smaller than temperature variations further inland.

10.  A light colored surface will reflect a large portion of the solar radiation. A dark surface will absorb most of it.

11.  There are two basic cloud forms – cumulus and stratus.

12.  Cumulus clouds have some vertical development, and result from rising currents of air. They represent unstable, but not necessarily bad flying weather.

13.  Stratus clouds form in horizontal layers. They result from the cooling of a stable layer. Stratus clouds represent stable flying, but not necessarily good flying conditions.

14.  Clouds are also classified into four families according to their altitude – low clouds, middle clouds, high clouds, and clouds that develop vertically and may span all three levels.

15.  High clouds are called cirrus and are almost entirely ice crystals. Their bases range in altitude from about 16,500 to 45,000 feet.

16.  Cirrocumulus clouds are high clouds formed by rising currents of air that cool as they rise. They look like puffy patches.

  

17.  Cirrostratus clouds indicate a high-level stable layer that was cooled enough for clouds to form. Cirrostratus look like a uniform layer high in the sky.

18.  Middle-level cloud bases extend from 6,500 to about 23,000 feet and are more frequently made of water than ice crystals.

19.  Middle-level clouds are named using the prefix alto.

20.  Altocumulus clouds are cumuliform clouds, indicating rising air currents and an unstable layer.

21.  Alto-stratus clouds are stratiform clouds indicating the cooling of a stable layer.

22.  Stratus clouds, producing precipitation, are called nimbostratus. They have a high water content and may be thousands of feet thick.

23.  Low-level cloud bases extend from the surface to about 6,500 feet. Low-level clouds are mostly water but may contain supercooled water drops which cause aircraft structural icing.

24.  Low-level clouds include stratus – layered clouds indicating a cooled stable layer at low-levels, and cumulus, indicating low-level vertical currents. A third type is stratocumulus – part cumulus and part stratus.

25.  Vertically developed clouds, the fourth family, indicate increased instability in the atmosphere. The extensive vertical development shows rising currents are penetrating high into the atmosphere.

26.  Towering cumulus and cumulonimbus, the thunderstorm cloud, indicate turbulence, wind shear, lightning, and possibly hail, and are quite an aviation hazard.

27.  Towering cumulus are tall cumulus clouds that may have enough energy to grow into cumulonimbus.

28.  Cumulonimbus may extend to an altitude of 60,000 feet or higher. These powerful storms are an extreme aviation hazard and must be avoided.

  

## Atmospheric Stability

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 12_

Atmospheric stability is an important concept for pilots to understand and it is a major factor when determining when rain showers and thunderstorms might develop.

### Review:

1.    In an unstable atmosphere vertically moving currents of air continue to move upward, possibly developing into cumulus clouds.

2.    Temperature changes caused by expansion or compression are called adiabatic temperature changes.

3.    As a volume of atmosphere expands, there is more distance between molecules, and therefore fewer collisions. So the temperature is lower. The standard ambient lapse rate is two degrees Celsius per 1,000 feet of altitude change.

4.    The dry adiabatic lapse rate is three degrees Celsius per 1,000 feet.

5.    Humid air at the surface is a good indicator of instability and the formation of afternoon thunderstorms. Whether the atmosphere is stable or unstable is determined by the ambient lapse rate and the amount of low-level moisture.

6.    Clouds are good indicators of stability, but there are more clues you can use. For example, if the temperature is constant or rises as altitude increases the air is stable.

7.    An inversion occurs when temperature rises as you ascend. A telltale sign of an inversion is an elevated layer of low visibility caused by the trapping of pollutants and other airborne particles in the stable layer.

8.    If the temperature decrease approaches 3 degrees Celsius for every 1,000 feet of ascent, suspect unstable conditions especially if the air near the ground is moist.

9.    When stable air crosses a mountain barrier, flying is relatively smooth on the windward side and standing lenticular clouds may form.

10. Always anticipate mountain wave turbulence when stable air is blown by strong winds of 40 knots or greater across mountain ridges.

11. Another cause of turbulence is wind shear which is the change of wind direction, wind speed, or both. Low-level wind shear is always present in thunderstorms.

12. Wind shear can lead to a stall – especially dangerous near the ground.

13. The low-level inversion may also be a wind shear zone – found just above the inversion.

14. Thunderstorms always have wind shear in and around them. Gusts in all thunderstorms can cause stalls and the downbursts associated with thunderstorms can be a deadly hazard to aviation.

15. All fronts are accompanied by a change in wind. Winds ahead of a cold front are usually from the south through southwest and behind the cold front blow from west through north.

16. Ahead of a warm front the wind is from the east through southeast and after warm frontal passage the winds blow from the south through the southwest.

  

17. Icing is another major weather hazard to aviation. Icing occurs when flying through visible water such as a cloud or rain and the temperature where the water strikes the aircraft is freezing or below.

18. Freezing rain will cause the most rapid and severe ice accumulation.

19. Frost can occur in clear air whenever the dew point temperature is freezing or below and the temperature of the airplane is equal to, or lower than, the dew point. Frost causes airflow separation reducing lift.

20. Never attempt takeoff with frost on the airplane.

  

## Air Facts: Laying a Foundation

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 13_

Because of the amount of IFR days during the year, you may want to consider acquiring an instrument rating as a next step in your learning process.

### Review:

1.    Practice studying the weather in relation to flying in VFR as well as IFR conditions. You may want to get an instrument rating somewhere down the line.

2.    You will be on your own after you get your Private Pilot certificate. No one will be checking your preparation prior to your cross-country flights.

3.    You will encounter days of MVFR weather. How will you handle it? Now is the time to set up personal guidelines and boundaries as to when you will fly and when you won't.

4.    Legal is definitely not always safe. Remember that weather is only reported at a few airport locations – who knows what it's like in between?

5.    To ensure a safe cross-county flight you want to set personal limits well above MVFR.

6.    Start to study IFR weather as if you already have the rating. What would be safe IFR conditions for you? Now is a good time to be laying the foundation for the ability to interpret weather data for use on an IFR flight as well as on a VFR flight.

7.    When you are flying VFR, you can often see the thunderstorms and avoid them.

8.    When you are VFR, icing can happen only in relatively rare freezing rain conditions. In IFR, icing occurs in the clouds, usually when the temperature is between minus 15 and 0 degrees Celsius.

  

## Winds Aloft, AIRMETs and SIGMETs

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 14_

In this section we will continue our study of the weather and discuss winds aloft forecasts, AIRMET and SIGMET hazardous weather forecasts and how to get in-flight weather updates using ADS-B.

### Review:

1.    Winds, direction of weather, and weather movement are measured from true north. The exceptions to this are winds you get over the radio for takeoff or landing, which are given as "magnetic," as are PIREPs and ASOS, AWOS and ATIS voice messages.

2.    Runways are numbered on the basis of magnetic north. This is because the instruments in your aircraft read magnetic. So, ATIS and ASOS voice broadcasts and telephone messages give winds relative to magnetic north.

3.    But, when sending a METAR on the computer, the ASOS reports the winds relative to true north not magnetic. A way to remember this is, "If it's in print, it must be true."

4.    Visibility is measured in statute miles. But the speed of weather movement and winds are measured in knots.

5.    Temperature, wind direction, and speed are forecast for specific levels.

6.    Wind is not forecast for levels which are less than 1,500 feet above a station.

7.    SIGMETs (significant meteorological information) deal with convective conditions, specifically thunderstorms.

8.    Severe weather forecast alerts indicate that a severe weather watch bulletin is being issued. Severe weather watch bulletins notify the public of areas of severe thunderstorms or tornadoes.

9.    SIGMETs also advise of weather, other than convective activity, potentially hazardous to all aircraft – including severe icing, severe or extreme turbulence, dust storms, sandstorms, or volcanic ash.

10.  Practice reading and interpreting SIGMETs.

11.  AIRMETs deal with weather that may be hazardous to light aircraft and VFR pilots. They cover moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or more, obscured mountains, and IFR conditions affecting more than half of an area.

  

## Closer Look: The Standards (ACS)

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 15_

In this section we will take a quick look at the airman certification standards that you'll encounter during the practical portion of your FAA test. As an example, turns around a point should be performed between 600 and 1,000 feet AGL.

### Review:

1.    The A-C-S integrates specific knowledge, skills, risk management elements and performance metrics for each task.

2.    FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners use these standards so that all pilot candidates will be tested to the same degree of proficiency.

3.    Use the ACS, included in this program, as a self-critiquing guide during solo.

4.    Included are items the examiner may quiz you on in the oral portion of the test.

5.    We'll examine these test standards more completely in the next volume.

  

## Basic Instrument Flying

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 16_

Before the 1950's, most general aviation airplanes did not have equipment for instrument flight. After that period, weight and cost reductions made it possible to fully equip light airplanes for instrument flight.

### Review:

1.    The pilot must be trained and qualified to fly by reference to instruments. To reduce weather related accidents, certification rules were changed to require private pilot applicants to demonstrate basic instrument flying skills.

2.    The skill level required is for emergency use of the flight instruments to survive an unintentional encounter with instrument weather conditions. It is not for unrestricted flight into instrument weather conditions.

3.    In most weather related accidents, pilots lose control of the airplane because of spatial disorientation.

4.    In this condition, the tendency is for a pilot to believe more of what he feels than the information from the flight instruments.

5.    There are three sensory systems for orientation – vision, inner ear, and the nerves of the muscles, joints, and skin.

6.    These confusing sensations can be made worse by making sudden head movements, especially when the airplane is turning or pitching.

7.    You must disregard these sensations, and control the airplane by believing the instruments.

8.    Flying the airplane on instruments is no different than flying with outside references.

9.    Various combinations of pitch and power result in level, climbing, or descending flight. Coordinated banks result in turns.

10.  The attitude indicator takes the place of the natural horizon – the only instrument which provides an instantaneous, direct, visual indication of the airplane's pitch and bank attitude.

11.  The other flight instruments can only give us an indirect indication of the attitude.

12.  The control performance method emphasizes the attitude indicator as the control instrument which is used to establish, change, and maintain attitudes. The other instruments are used to check the performance produced by the attitude of the airplane.

13.  A second method labels instruments as being either primary or supporting. Primary is used to indicate the instrument which gives the most pertinent information and supporting indicates those instruments which confirm that information.

14.  For example, in level flight, the altimeter is used as the primary instrument for pitch – airspeed and the vertical speed indicators could be seen as supporting.

15.  Three skills are involved in all instrument flight. They are scanning the instruments, interpreting the instrument indications, and aircraft control.

  

16.  An instrument scan must be developed before you can interpret the instrument indications.

17.  Some common scanning errors are fixation, omission of an instrument, or too much emphasis on a single instrument.

18.  Fixation occurs when you stare at one instrument. Omission of an instrument is usually caused by failing to anticipate the result of an attitude change. Eye scan studies show that proficient instrument pilots spend up to three quarters of the time looking at the attitude indicator.

19.  The components of airplane control are power, pitch, and bank.

20.  Trim must be used to relieve control pressures.

21.  The instructor is responsible for watching for other aircraft. Simulated instrument flight is not done solo.

22.  The attitude indicator simplifies pitch and bank control. Supporting instruments are the altimeter for level flight, and the heading indicator for straight flight.

23.  When making small corrections, avoid over controlling.

24.  The width of the attitude indicator horizon bar is an excellent reference for pitch changes to correct altitude.

25.  Pitch changes to correct 100 feet or less of altitude should not exceed half the width of the horizon bar, or half a dot on indicators which do not have a wide horizon bar.

26.  If altitude is off by more than 100 feet, initially use a full bar width or full dot of change.

27.  For more precise control of bank, use the bank pointer and the banking index at the top of the attitude indicator, rather than the miniature airplane wings.

28.  In straight flight, slight deviations from wings level can be corrected by using rudder. When correcting for a heading deviation, use coordinated aileron and rudder.

29.  In straight-and-level flight, the vertical speed indicator should remain in the zero position. The airspeed indicator should show normal cruise speed. The turn coordinator or turn needle should be centered with the ball centered, showing coordinated flight.

30.  Climbs and descents on instruments are to be made straight at constant airspeed. The pitch attitude for climbs and descents can be determined by checking the attitude indicator when making climbs and descents using outside references.

31.  To enter a climb straight ahead, raise the nose of the miniature airplane to the approximate climb attitude while increasing to climb power. As the airspeed slows add nose up trim. Use right rudder to compensate for the left turning tendency.

32.  With a constant power setting, airspeed changes can only be made by changing pitch. If a pitch change is necessary, use the attitude indicator and make small adjustments. Don't expect the airspeed to change quickly.

33.  As the pitch change is made, the vertical speed indicator will show the trend by moving upward but will not show the actual rate of climb until several seconds after the climb stabilizes.

34.  Use the heading indicator as the instrument for straight flight.

35.  When the climb is stabilized, use the trim to relieve control pressure.

36.  As a rule of thumb, a level off from both climbs and descents should be started approximately 10 percent of the rate of climb or descent prior to reaching the assigned

  

altitude. For example, at 500 feet per minute, start your level off 50 feet before the desired altitude.

37.  As airspeed reaches cruise, reduce power to cruise power setting and make the final trim adjustment.

38.  To enter a straight descent, first reduce power to the desired setting, and apply back pressure to maintain altitude.

39.  To correct airspeed, make small pitch changes, using the attitude indicator to make the changes. When the airspeed is stabilized make the final trim adjustment.

40.  Keep the wings level using the attitude indicator, and use the heading indicator to check for and correct deviations from the desired heading.

41.  Turns by reference to the instruments should be limited to no more than standard rate. Turns of less than 30 degrees should be made at half standard rate.

42.  Using coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, establish the desired bank on the attitude indicator. Use the banking scale on the top of the instrument.

43.  At relatively shallow bank angles, very little back pressure is needed to maintain altitude.

44.  If you are losing altitude, shallow the bank rather than adding a lot of back pressure. Check, but don't fixate, on the heading indicator.

45.  To roll out, assuming a 15 degree bank, start the roll out about 8 degrees before reaching the new heading. Less bank will require less lead.

46.  You'll be asked to close your eyes and take your hands and feet from the controls. The instructor will then put the airplane in either a diving spiral or a nose high attitude approaching a stall. You'll then be told to open your eyes take the controls and return the airplane to straight-and-level flight.

47.  The attitude indicator will give you an instantaneous direct indication of the pitch and bank attitude.

48.  Pitch attitude can be indirectly determined by the airspeed indicator, the vertical speed indicator, and the altimeter. The bank can be indirectly determined by the heading and turn indicators.

49.  If the nose is high with the airspeed decreasing, use the same recovery technique used in the approach to the stall, add power to prevent altitude loss, lower the pitch attitude to the level flight position and level the wings.

50.  The other possible unusual attitude is when the pitch attitude is below level flight, and airspeed is increasing. Reduce power to prevent excessive airspeed, level the wings, and then raise the nose to the level flight attitude.

51.  Using radio aids to navigation, while controlling the airplane by reference to the instruments, adds to your workload both physically and mentally.

52.  Your first concern is to fly the airplane. Keeping the wings level is a primary concern.

  

## Air Facts: Calm in the Clouds

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 17_

At first, flying on instruments will seem uncomfortable. Once you do it for a while, things get a lot better.

### Review:

1.    Learn to make gentle corrections and become smooth on the controls. A small altitude or heading adjustment can be done with very slight pressures.

2.    Don't rush. Occasionally, relax your grip on the control wheel and lift your feet off the rudder pedals.

3.    To prevent flying into adverse weather, always fly in conditions that are better than minimum.

4.    Weather accidents often take two forms; the pilot flies into terrain or an obstruction or gets into clouds and loses control of the aircraft. In this second case, disorientation often leads to a graveyard spiral.

5.    If this happens, you must roll the wings level and then pull the airplane out of the dive.

6.    An airplane is not so stable in roll – concentrate on keeping the wings level.

7.    Don't allow any distraction when you are turning.

8.    Make gentle control inputs.

  

## Flying Out of Trouble

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 18_

In this section we investigate what to do if you encounter adverse conditions causing you to fly on instruments.

### Review:

1.    To reduce inadvertent instrument flight in IFR, become well prepared before you fly. Prevention is better than a cure. The best prevention is getting, and heeding, a preflight weather briefing.

2.    In many weather related accidents, the pilot did not get a weather briefing or flew in the face of a bad one. In some cases, pilots thought they could handle forecast bad weather. In others, marginal conditions became worse than forecast.

3.    Occasionally it turns out that the flight could have been made. However, don't look back on missed flights that may have turned out okay. Rather, consider all the times the poor forecasts were correct.

4.    Don't fly when weather conditions are at the bare legal minimum requirements. In controlled airspace the legal VFR minimum is a 1,000 foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility. That's not much.

5.    Be especially wary at night. Usually the first sign of clouds is when the ground lights disappear and the navigation lights glow in the cloud.

6.    Keep up with what's happening to the weather while you are en route. Flight watch and flight service stations are there to serve you.

7.    To ask for help, climb to enhance communications and radar detection. Communicate with the nearest ground station. Confess your predicament and comply with instructions.

8.    If you are not sure of the frequency, use the emergency frequency 121.5. ATC will help you.

9.    ATC can vector you to VFR or provide headings to keep you clear of obstructions.

10.  The controller will determine your position. Then, he will tell you the minimum safe altitude for your location. He will then ask for more information such as fuel remaining, airspeed, and navigation capability.

11.  Remember, in all of this, the final decision rests with you – you are PIC.

12.  If fuel remaining allows, choose radar vectors. The controller will assign headings and altitudes to fly to VFR conditions.

13.  If VFR conditions cannot be reached, you will have to make a radar approach to an airport – an ASR, approach.

14.  The controller vectors the aircraft to a position on final at least 3 miles from the runway, and calls the aircraft position each mile from the runway.

15.  He will give you the heading to fly, minimum altitudes, when to descend, how to abandon the approach, and the missed approach point.

  

16.  If you are having difficulty controlling the airplane, request a no-gyro approach. This approach is used if the aircraft does not have a functioning heading indicator or the pilot is not able to maintain heading within reasonable limits.

17.  During a no-gyro approach the controller will tell you when to start and stop turns.

18.  On final approach the turns should be made at half standard rate.

  

## Closer Look: ASOS - Behind the Scenes

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 19_

Most weather observations come from an automated system called an ASOS - Automated Surface Observing System - or an AWOS - Automated Weather Observing System.

### Review:

1.    An ASOS is typically placed near a runway and is simply a collection of weather instruments. Measurements of temperature, dew point, and precipitation are measured by a thermometer, a hygrothermometer, and heated tipping bucket gauge, respectively.

2.    Algorithms in the ASOS process the data to make a complete weather report.

3.    Because it is not a human, there are limitations to what an ASOS can report. Tornadoes, smoke, snowfall accumulations, and virga are some of the meteorological phenomena that cannot be sampled by an ASOS.

4.    An ASOS is often too slow to report a significant change in cloud cover.

5.    AWOSs are very similar to ASOSs, but AWOSs can have fewer weather instruments.

6.    METARs may be augmented or adjusted by FAA observers at major airports in the United States.

7.    It is important to review the date and time when you read a weather observation to ensure it is the most up-to-date information available.

  

## Lost and Found

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 20_

In this section we will discuss the best way to handle getting off course, becoming lost, and asking for help.

### Review:

1.    A common problem on a cross-country flight is getting off course or temporarily becoming disoriented.

2.    For example, unexpected poor visibility or a wind shift develops that causes you to miss seeing some checkpoints, causing you to drift off course.

3.    As you proceed, you will keep track of each checkpoint and the surrounding terrain.

4.    What if you don't see anything you recognize?

5.    First of all, don't panic. You are probably just a bit off course.

6.    Stay on your heading and watch for landmarks you might recognize while reviewing your calculations.

7.    Use your calculated compass heading, time, and groundspeed, and figure where you would be in a no- wind condition. In this way you can estimate the distance from your last known position and determine a point within an area where the airplane may be located. This area is frequently called a circle of error.

8.    Draw a circle around this point, 5 to 8 miles in diameter. You are somewhere in this circle.

9.    Continue on your original compass heading and check the landmarks within this circle. Especially check on the downwind side of your course line, since the wind may have drifted you off course.

10.  If possible, climb to a higher altitude so you can get a better view of the area.

11.  When you find a recognizable landmark, continue on but don't make an abrupt course change until you verify with two or more additional landmarks that you are back on the course you want.

12.  What if you can't figure out your location? If you have maintained your heading, turn toward the nearest concentration of landmarks shown on the chart and then reorient yourself. Or, if possible, land at a local airport and regroup.

13.  Your ability to cope with a changing situation will prove invaluable in your flying career.

14.  In the future, when weather, fuel, or simply changing your mind about a destination requires a diversion to an alternate, you will be able to do it successfully.

15.  It's always good to have an out or an alternate plan if problems arise.

16.  Once back on course, figure out what went wrong so the same mistake will not be made again.

17.  When navigating only by pilotage and dead reckoning, make sure you keep an accurate time and checkpoint log. Adjust your wind correction angle to reflect actual wind speed

  

and direction if different than forecast. Double check that you are reading the map and compass correctly and are using the proper scale on the plotter.

18.  Whenever possible, use radio navigation aids to help keep on course.

19.  If you are using VOR, turn up the audio and listen to the voice or Morse code identifier to identify the station. If you don't hear one or the other, the station is probably down.

20.  Try another VOR and see what happens – your VOR receiver may be inoperative.

21.  If your VOR receiver isn't working, communicate your problem with FSS, ATC, or a local control tower if necessary. Use the emergency frequency of 121.5.

22.  If you do contact ATC, you will be given a transponder code so they can identify you and your position. The controller will give you vectors to reach your destination.

23.  Once you are in sight of your destination, the controller will let you go and say, "Radar service is terminated, squawk 1200. Frequency change approved."

24.  If you plan well and fly your plan, the likelihood of having a real problem on any of your cross-country trips is remote.

  

## ForeFlight Weather Imagery

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 21_

The ForeFlight app is an excellent resource for flight planning and preflight weather, allowing you to view weather layers directly on the moving map.

### Review:

1.    For a more comprehensive collection of weather forecast charts and graphics, head over to the Imagery section of the app. This is the place to find prognostic charts, surface weather charts, cloud forecasts and much more.

2.    By default, most images are for the United States, and come from the Aviation Weather Center at the National Weather Service.

3.    In general, there’s a loose top-to-bottom flow that mirrors the way you plan a flight: start with big picture weather maps and long range forecasts at the top, then work down toward current observations that affect smaller areas, like radar and PIREPs. it’s easier to work through Imagery in a systematic way.

4.    First, look at the big picture. Whether you’re flying VFR or IFR, it’s always smart to begin with a look at the major weather systems.

5.    Where are the highs and lows, the cold fronts and warm fronts? Where are these systems forecast to move? Use the Prog Charts product to answer these questions, and get an overview of major weather trends.

6.    6 Hr Qty of Precipitation and 12 hour Prob of Precipitation (or PoP) are oddly-named charts, but they’re really valuable. That’s because, while moisture or precipitation doesn’t necessarily equate to bad weather, there’s often a correlation.

7.    In the winter, areas of precipitation often mean icing aloft; in the fall it might mean IFR conditions. Get a general sense of where the moisture is and where it’s moving (or not as the case may be).

8.    The other benefit of these precipitation forecasts is that they stretch out far into the future. Whereas TAFs are fairly near term forecasts, the PoP forecast goes out to 7 days. That’s valuable if you’re planning the return leg of an out and back trip. Use it to get a general sense of the long term weather trends.

9.    The final piece of the “big picture” briefing is a look at convective hazards, which you can find in the last three maps in the first section (CONUS weather).

10. Convective hazards can be added to your knowledge of the precipitation areas to determine whether that precip is just rain or perhaps something a lot more serious.

11. With that background in mind, the graphical aviation forecasts will make a lot more sense. You’ll find two different types of charts here – cloud and surface forecasts. Both rely on computer models to generate the data shown on the charts.

12. The Cloud forecast maps graphically depict cloud coverage across the U.S. and includes AIRMETs for ice and mountain obscurations.

  

13. The surface chart forecasts visibility, surface winds, precipitation and other weather hazards.

14. Next it’s time to consider the full three dimensions of the atmosphere. Specifically, ForeFlight offers forecasts for three conditions at altitude – winds, icing and turbulence.

15. The winds aloft forecast maps are helpful for choosing the fastest cruise altitude, but they are also valuable for understanding how the highs and lows are moving.

16. For instrument pilots, the icing forecasts are essential maps. You can get a detailed look at potential in-flight icing risks, by both altitude and time.

17. The legends on the icing forecasts explain the colors well, but make sure you know whether the chart you’re viewing forecasts the probability of icing (that is, how likely it is that icing conditions exist) or the severity of icing (whether any ice will be light, moderate or severe). You could be flying in an area where the probability is high but the severity is low - or vice versa.

18. Comparing different altitudes will tell you which altitudes might be above or below any potential icing.

19. The turbulence charts can help you find a smooth ride. Like the winds aloft, they are divided into low-level, mid-level, and high-level sections, with each section showing specific altitudes and forecasts out to 18 hours.

20. The turbulence charts are further divided by the cause of turbulence: clear air or mountain wave.

21. Like the icing forecasts, the turbulence maps are model-driven, so back them up with actual Pilot Reports.

22. All three of the upper level products - winds, turbulence, and icing - make it easy to plan not only your route, but the right altitude.

23. So far we’ve dealt with mostly forecasts – that is, predictions about what might happen. These are helpful, especially if your flight isn’t for a few days.

24. As you get closer to your time of departure, you need more real-time, more regional information – observations instead of forecasts. The three main observations in ForeFlight are satellite, radar and PIREPs.

25. Remember that, that satellite, radar, and PIREPs can be overlaid on the Maps page.

  

## Self-Serve Fuel

_Private Pilot Chapter 5 – Video Segment 22_

Many airports offer a self-serve fuel option at a cheaper price per gallon, which can offer big savings for large fill-ups and serve as a plan B for fuel when landing after hours when the FBO is closed.

### Review:

1.    First, identify the location of the fuel pump at the airport.

2.    Park close to the pump, but not too close.
