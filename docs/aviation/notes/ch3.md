## Pre-Solo Maneuvers

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 1_

In this section we will discuss S-turns Across A Road and Turns Around A Point, as well as the techniques to do them successfully. Their objective is to maintain a prescribed ground track while in turning flight.

### Review:

1.    S-turns across a road and turns around a point require changing the bank and the crab to maintain the desired ground track.

2.    A constant bank turn makes a circle in the air, but wind drift will affect the ground track. To make a uniform circle on the ground, you must vary the bank angle and crab to compensate for the wind.

3.    Before beginning s-turns across a road, practice doing a 360 degree circle using bank angle and crab to correct for wind drift.

4.    Center the circle on some point on the ground. Start the turn directly downwind. To compensate for the faster groundspeed, you'll need a steep bank here. Turning from the direct tailwind, the bank will be lessened progressively until you are upwind where the wings are almost level. As the turn continues, the bank increases to its steepest point when it is headed downwind.

5.    In s-turns across a road, the airplane makes semi circles of equal size on each side of a straight line on the ground. This line should be at a right angle to the wind. Roads, railroad tracks, or fence lines can be used.

6.    Start the maneuver at a right angle to the road. Begin a 180 degree turn and trace a uniform semi- circle over the ground. Coming back over the road, your wings should be level. Now turn in the opposite direction and trace an identical semi circle on the other side. The maneuver is finished when the airplane is again wings level over the road.

7.    Try to start the maneuver downwind, wings level, crossing the road so your first bank is the steepest. As the semi-circle continues, the bank is lessened. When crosswind, a crab is utilized to correct for the wind.

8.    At the midpoint, pick a spot to cross the road in order to keep the semi circle uniform. From the midpoint on, bank and crab are decreased, so that when crossing the road wings level, the airplane is headed at a right angle.

9.    Now, pick the spot where you want the airplane to be halfway around the upwind semi circle. The moment the road is crossed start a turn in the opposite direction. With a direct headwind the bank will be shallowest. As the wind changes from headwind to crosswind, start to steepen the bank.

  

10.  Halfway around the upwind semi circle, the airplane has turned less than 90 degrees and has the maximum crab into the wind. Pick the spot where you want to cross the road. As the wind becomes a tailwind, steepen the bank to finish the 180 degrees of turn over the road.

11.  In doing turns around a point you're putting the two halves of the s-turn together to trace a full circle on the ground.

12.  The maneuver consists in making two or more complete circles at a constant altitude, while maintaining a constant distance from a point on the ground.

13.  The point you choose should be prominent. A fence line, intersection, or the center of a crossroads is ideal because you can easily project ahead every 90 degrees.

14.  The bank should not exceed 45 degrees, so start on a downwind heading where groundspeed is highest and maximum bank is necessary.

15.  The bank and crab control is the same as used in s-turns.

16.  Your second turn is a repetition of the first. It gives you the chance to correct errors and fine tune the maneuver.

  

## Closer Look: International Flight Training

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 2_

In this section we will meet Sophie Gilgean. Sophie is a Belgian citizen who came to the United States and enrolled in the University of Cincinnati’s professional pilot program after getting her private license in Belgium.

### Review:

1.    The cost to learn to fly in Europe is considerably more expensive and you may often be flying older aircraft that are much more expensive than better equipped, more modern aircraft in the US.

2.    They have other costs as well that you don't have here in the U.S.

3.    You pay a landing fee every time you land on a field or do a touch and go.

4.    You also pay for any IFR flight plan under instrument conditions, and you have to pay for any instrument approach that you make.

5.    Because the European countries can be small, planning cross-country flights can also be a challenge.

  

## Steep Turns

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 3_

In this section we will discuss steep turns made at a constant bank. These are turns with a bank of 45 degrees or more.

### Review:

1.    First of all we'll look at Newton's first law – a body in motion will continue in motion at the same speed and direction until an outside force is applied to that body.

2.    Any force applied to an airplane, to deflect it from straight flight, will produce a stress on the airplane's structure.

3.    At rest, gravity exerts a force equal to the weight of the airplane. Gravity is expressed in Gs and on the earth's surface the force on an at-rest airplane is 1G.

4.    Aerodynamic stress on the airplane is called load factor. A load factor of two is called two Gs.

5.    Airplanes are certified and categorized according to the intended use of the airplane. The categories we are concerned with are: normal, utility, and acrobatic. Normal category airplanes are intended for non acrobatic flight, while utility category airplanes may be used for limited acrobatics.

6.    The maneuvering limit load factor for a normal category airplane is 3.8 positive and 1.52 negative Gs, utility category is 4.4 positive and 1.76 negative and acrobatic category, 6 positive and 3 negative.

7.    Actually, airplane structures must be capable of sustaining loads one and one half times these limit load factors to account for unexpected conditions.

8.    Bank determines the load factor on any airplane during a constant altitude turn and is the result of centrifugal force and gravity.

9.    A bank of sixty degrees has a load factor of two Gs. You will also weigh twice your weight at two Gs.

10.  As the Gs increase so does stall speed.

11.  In a steep bank turn, a reduction in back pressure reduces the load factor, but the airplane will descend. To reduce the load factor and maintain altitude, reduce the bank.

12.  The speed at which an airplane stalls before exceeding the design limit load is called maneuvering speed. Maneuvering speed changes depending on the weight of the airplane.

13.  Maneuvering speed should not be exceeded in rough air or when making full or abrupt control movements.

14.  Steep turns call for orientation, power control, and rapid application of smooth and varying control pressures.

15.  To maintain altitude you must use a higher pitch attitude and more power to compensate for the added drag.

  

16.  Do your steep turn for 360 degrees and start on one of the cardinal points of the compass. Pick a prominent point, like a road or other landmark, to help you judge the completion of the turn. Use a 45 degree bank, and maintain altitude within 100 feet.

17.  After 30 degrees, increase power as necessary, and increase back elevator pressure.

18.  Don't stare at any one thing. Cross-check the attitude indicator with the nose, wings, horizon, altimeter, and reference point as you turn.

19.  If you are losing altitude, don't correct with back pressure only. This will tighten the turn. Shallow the bank by 5 or 10 degrees, and then increase the pitch attitude. Return to the 45 degree bank after the airplane is back to the starting altitude.

20.  If the airplane is climbing, you can make a slight increase in the bank or a small decrease in back pressure.

21.  You may need to hold some aileron pressure against the turn to keep the bank from increasing.

22.  You will probably need a slight amount of right rudder pressure during a steep turn, and even more right rudder pressure to enter one to the right.

23.  When the airplane's heading is within 25 to 35 degrees of the reference point, apply opposite aileron and rudder pressure to roll out of the turn, relaxing back elevator pressure and reducing power to the level flight setting.

  

## Closer Look: Touch and Go

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 4_

In this section we will discuss the touch and go. That is, on landing, while still rolling, you will put the airplane in its takeoff configuration and takeoff without stopping.

### Review:

1.    Touch and go's are a way to practice takeoffs and landings without the added time used to pull off the runway and taxi back to the departure end.

2.    The touch and go should not be taken lightly as there are a variety of items to adjust such as flaps and trim while still maintaining primary focus on controlling the airplane.

3.    Another version of the touch and go is called a "stop and go." The airplane is brought to a full stop on the runway before again taking off.

4.    At a tower controlled field, ask for a touch and go or a stop and go from the tower by requesting the "option." For example, "Lunken tower, Cessna 3-7-7-Echo Sierra, request the option, 2-1- left."

5.    At a nontowered field announce your intentions. For example, "Clermont County traffic, Cessna niner five one seven Sierra is downwind, runway 4, touch and go, Clermont."

  

## Emergencies

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 5_

In this section we discuss emergencies. Pilots need to recognize the possibility that emergencies can occur and be prepared.

### Review:

1.    The regulations state that in an emergency the pilot may deviate from any rule to the extent required to meet that emergency.

2.    For example, if the engine fails on takeoff, don't turn back to the runway. Your chances of making a 180 degree turn with a dead engine while in a climbing attitude at a slow airspeed, are not good. Instead, get the nose down quickly, maintain flying speed, and make the best landing you can under the circumstances.

3.    If you have a partial power failure on takeoff, fly straight ahead and try to gain some altitude. Keep all turns shallow and gradually turn back to the airport. Once back in the pattern, keep the power on until you are sure you can land normally.

4.    Your instructor will simulate engine failures at cruise altitude. Your first concern should be to fly the airplane and establish the best glide speed. Look for a suitable landing field. The goal is to complete a safe landing in the largest and best field available.

5.    If you have enough altitude, you can spiral down and try to enter a downwind leg as normal. If you are lower than 1,000 feet, set up the best approach you can under the circumstances.

6.    Follow the emergency landing checklist for your airplane. For example, establish best glide speed, check that the fuel shutoff valve is ON, set the fuel selector valve on BOTH, turn the auxiliary fuel pump ON, mixture to RICH if restart has not occurred, ignition switch to BOTH, or START, if the propeller is stopped.

7.    If power is not restored, prepare for a power off landing – seat backs upright, seats and seat belts secure, mixture idle cutoff, fuel shutoff valve OFF, ignition OFF, flaps as required, approach speed as required, master switch OFF when landing is assured, and unlatch the doors prior to touchdown.

8.    Once you select a field, try and stick with it and never try to stretch a glide. Discontinue the exercise when it's apparent you can make the field.

9.    Instrument failure is also a cause of emergencies. To simulate an instrument emergency in the pattern, your instructor may cover the airspeed indicator or altimeter. With the proper pitch and power combination you can land quite nicely without an airspeed reference.

  

## Air Facts: Emergencies

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 6_

In an emergency, try to use the radio and announce your problem. However, it's up to you to safely handle the emergency.

### Review:

1.    Rule number one, stay as calm as possible – panic will only make things worse.

2.    If the situation is critical, like in the case of an engine fire, recall the memory items from the checklist and accomplish those without delay.

3.    Once the memory items are completed, assess the situation and focus on flying the airplane. Grab the emergency checklist and complete every item on the list to help remedy the situation.

4.    You will be able to stay composed if you know what to do in each type of emergency.

5.    Since most emergencies are preceded by a warning of some kind, stay alert and act on the information as soon as possible. By doing this, you will short circuit most true emergencies.

  

## Fog & Atmospheric Pressure

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 7_

In this section we begin the study of weather. As a pilot you must learn to recognize, respect, and refrain from flying near marginal or hazardous weather.

### Review:

1.    Weather occurring on the ground may not be what's happening higher up.

2.    Clouds can be good indicators of the type of weather going on. Clouds are the visible collection of minute ice or water particles suspended in the air. There are many types of clouds.

3.    Clouds are either in layers or piled up vertically.

4.    Layered clouds are called stratus, and indicate stable conditions – expect a relatively smooth flight, with fair to poor visibility. If there is precipitation, it's usually widespread, light to moderate rain or snow. Layer clouds found on the surface are classified as fog.

5.    Cumulus clouds are those with vertical development. A cumulonimbus cloud is a cumulus cloud which is producing precipitation – expect a bumpy flight with good crisp visibility. Rain or snow is usually heavy and localized. They indicate that the air is unstable, thus the bumpy ride.

6.    The earth has an atmosphere around it. The first layer of the atmosphere is the troposphere, extending from the surface to approximately 40,000 feet. At the top of the troposphere, the tropopause marks the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere.

7.    In an inversion, the temperature increases with altitude and results in a stable atmosphere. Inversions cause low visibilities by trapping fog, smoke, dust, and other pollutants close to the surface.

8.    Two moisture related weather conditions are fog and thunderstorms.

9.    Evaporation, condensation, sublimation, deposition, freezing, or melting change water from vapor to liquid to ice or back the other way.

10.  Condensation is the process which makes invisible water vapor appear as clouds or liquid drops.

11.  The amount of water vapor in the air is largely dependent upon the air's temperature. Cold air contains less water vapor, warm air more.

12.  Relative humidity is the relationship between the amount of water vapor in the air in comparison to the maximum amount that could exist at that temperature.

13.  The temperature at which relative humidity reaches one hundred percent is called the dew point. At the dew point, air becomes saturated with water vapor.

14.  If the temperature and dew point get within three degrees or less of each other, clouds or fog, may form.

15.  Fog is formed by either the addition of moisture to the air, or cooling the air to the dew point, or a combination of the two working together.

  

16.  Radiation fog, called ground fog, forms on a clear, cold night when the surface of the earth is cooled by radiation until the temperature of the air near the surface is below initial dew point. Cooling of the air causes fog to form. Light winds deepen the fog while stronger winds tend to disperse it.

17.  Advection fog, sometimes called sea fog, occurs mostly along coasts and is caused by wind transporting warm moist air to a colder surface. Winter advection fog, caused by strong southerly winds off the Gulf of Mexico, may cover the eastern U.S – as far north as the Great Lakes. Light to moderate winds deepen the fog while strong winds lift the fog forming low stratus clouds.

18.  Upslope fog is caused by wind forcing moist stable air up a sloping land surface. Moist unstable air forced upward by mountain lift, called orographic lift, will form cumulus clouds instead of fog.

19.  Precipitation induced fog is caused by the evaporation of rain or drizzle. It can form rapidly over a large area and persist for an extended period.

20.  Ice fog forms in conditions similar to the conditions favorable for radiation fog, with the difference being that extremely cold temperatures exist.

21.  Calm or light winds are favorable for fog formation. Higher wind speeds tend to mix the air and prevent its cooling to the dew point. Fog is apt to form when the temperature-dew point spread is small. Dense fog is more likely in urban industrial areas than in rural areas since condensation nuclei are typically more abundant there. Finally, be alert for cooling processes, such as onshore winds at night, radiational cooling of land during clear nights, or upslope winds.

22.  At sea level on an average day, the atmosphere exerts a force of 14.7 pounds per square inch. At 18,000 feet, the pressure is approximately one half, or 7.32 pounds per square inch.

23.  The term standard day is defined as one in which the temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure, at sea level, is 29.92 inches of mercury. From there, temperature and pressure decrease at a standard rate as you go upward in the atmosphere.

24.  The altimeter measures the change in atmospheric pressure and reads it out in feet of altitude. Atmospheric pressure drops approximately 1 inch of mercury for every 1,000 feet of altitude below 10,000 feet. Therefore, it's important to reset the altimeter periodically as you fly to keep it accurate.

25.  Temperature affects the altimeter because the atmosphere expands and contracts with changes in temperature. Cold temperatures make the atmosphere contract. Remember, "High temperatures to low, look out below." Look out below because the aircraft is lower than the altimeter indicates.

26.  The reverse of high to low is also true. If you fly from a low pressure to a high pressure area without resetting the altimeter, you will have the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates.

27.  Flying from cold to high temperatures will also put the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates. Remember, "Low temperature to high, look to the sky".

  

## Closer Look: Atmospheric Pressure

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 8_

In this section we'll use an example to illustrate that pressure decreases as you fly higher. The gasses in the air become less tightly packed at higher altitudes, and therefore exert less pressure.

### Review:

1.    The higher up you go, the less dense the atmosphere becomes.

2.    As an example, blow up a balloon part way on the ground and put it in an airplane. As the airplane climbs, the balloon will expand because the air pressure decreases with altitude.

3.    As the airplane descends, the balloon will contract because more of the atmosphere is pushing in on it.

4.    We have essentially made a crude altimeter.

5.    This also illustrates why there is less air available for the airplane's engine to use higher up. The engine ingests air by volume, so even though the volume of the air going into the engine is the same, there are physically fewer air molecules contained in each volume.

  

## The Pitot Static System

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 9_

The pitot-static system drives the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator. As a pilot, it's important to understand how this system works.

### Review:

1.    The airspeed indicator is an extremely sensitive pressure gauge. It measures the difference between impact pressure measured at the pitot tube, and static pressure, sampled by the static source, which is the undisturbed atmospheric pressure.

2.    There are three kinds of airspeeds: Indicated Airspeed, the airspeed read directly from the indicator. Calibrated Airspeed is indicated airspeed corrected for errors. At normal cruise speeds there usually is very little difference between indicated and calibrated airspeed. True Airspeed, which corrects calibrated airspeed for variations in air density.

3.    As altitude increases, the air density decreases, and the ram or impact pressure in the airspeed indicator decreases.

4.    The airspeed indicator has color markings. The green arc shows the normal operating range. The low airspeed end of the green arc indicates the stalling speed power off, flaps up, at maximum certificated weight. The upper limit of the green arc is the maximum structural cruising speed.

5.    The yellow arc represents speeds that should only be flown in smooth air. The red radial line marks the never exceed speed. The white arc is the full flap operating range, with the upper limit the maximum speed for full flaps extended. The lower limit is the power off stalling speed at maximum certificated landing weight with flaps extended.

6.    Maneuvering speed is not marked on the airspeed indicator. If rough air or turbulence is encountered, the airplane should be slowed to maneuvering speed to minimize the stress on the airplane.

7.    The altimeter is an aneroid barometer which measures atmospheric pressure and gives an altitude indication in feet.

8.    Because atmospheric pressure is constantly changing, the altimeter indications will be correct only if the instrument has been set to the current atmospheric pressure.

9.    If the altimeter setting is increased, the altitude indicated will also increase and vice versa. Changing the altimeter setting one inch of mercury will change the indicated altitude about 1,000 feet.

10.  There are different types of altitude. Indicated Altitude is read directly off the altimeter when it is set to the current altimeter setting. Pressure Altitude is read when the altimeter is set to 29.92. Pressure altitude is used to solve calculator problems of true airspeed and density altitude. Density Altitude is pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature.

11.  If the temperature is warmer than standard, density altitude will be higher than pressure altitude. Temperatures colder than standard, will make the density altitude lower than

  

pressure altitude. Density altitude must be known to calculate takeoff, climb, and landing performance.

12.  Absolute altitude is the actual height above the terrain and is constantly changing.

13.  True altitude is the true vertical distance above mean sea level. On aeronautical charts, the airport, terrain, and obstruction heights shown are true altitudes. Unless there is an extreme variation from standard temperature, indicated altitude is reasonably close to true altitude.

14.  The vertical speed indicator works from the static system. It measures the rate of change in pressure, giving a readout in feet per minute of climb or descent. It has a 6 to 9 second lag in its indications.

15.  If the exterior static source becomes blocked, the pitot-static system can be returned to operation by selecting the alternate static source, venting the system to the cabin.

  

## Closer Look: Pilot’s Operating Handbook

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 10_

The Pilot's Operating Handbook is an important tool for your safe flying. It's a required item to keep on board when flying. All the important data you need regarding your airplane is in this book.

### Review:

1.    Most modern operating handbooks are published in a standardized format common to all aircraft manufacturers, and outline the pertinent information specific to that airplane.

2.    It covers areas like aircraft performance, electrical failure in flight, and a complete emergency procedures section with appropriate checklists.

3.    There are two types of handbooks, the official one that's in the airplane, and a generic one.

4.    Student pilots and renters usually obtain a generic copy of an aircraft information manual for flight planning and study. The official POH should remain in the aircraft.

  

## METARs and the Weather Depiction Chart

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 11_

In this section you will learn how to read and interpret METARs, which are hourly reports of airport weather conditions.

### Review:

1.    Reports are conditions in the atmosphere observed at a specific time. Always take into account the time the observation was made because weather changes.

2.    The weather depiction chart gives a big picture overview of weather conditions. It shows areas of adverse weather, areas of good weather, and the fronts associated with the weather.

3.    Areas where the weather conditions were reported as instrument flight rules (IFR) are shown by shading inside the contours. This occurs whenever the ceiling is less than 1000 feet and/or the surface visibility is less than 3 statute miles or both. Marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) is shown in areas without shading. VFR exists anywhere outside the contours.

4.    The ceiling is always the lowest layer of clouds that covers more than half of the sky. If there is a ceiling, at least 3 quarters of the station circle is filled in. For more on the weather depiction chart, review the symbology of a station model.

5.    A METAR is an hourly report of actual weather existing at an airport. If the weather changes in a way not reported in the original METAR, and before the next scheduled METAR, a special METAR is issued. It's called a SPECI. To be able to understand the METAR, review the abbreviations used. A translated version can be obtained as well.

  

## Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF)

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 12_

In this section you will learn how to read and interpret a TAF, which is a 24 or 30 hour weather forecast issued for specific airports.

### Review:

1.    In general, a short range forecast is more accurate than a long range forecast. A newer forecast is more accurate than an older forecast. A forecast of good weather, generally, is more accurate than a forecast of bad weather.

2.    Pilots must carefully analyze a forecast to make a sound decision. To do this, check the present weather against the weather that was forecast for the same time period. Be suspicious of any forecast that varies greatly from the current weather conditions.

3.    The area forecast is a prediction of general weather conditions for an area the size of several states. It's used mostly to check en route weather.

4.    At this point in your flight training, the most useful forecast is the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF), because it's specific to an airport.

5.    TAFs cover wind, visibility, weather phenomena, obstructions to vision, and cloud coverage expected during specific periods during the day.

6.    TAFs are a detailed twenty-four or thirty hour forecast of weather conditions expected to occur within a five mile radius of a specific airport. TAFs are issued four times daily, 0000z, 0600z, 1200z, and 1800z and amended as necessary.

7.    TAFs are written much like the METAR. Review the abbreviations used in the TAF. The TAF can be obtained in a translated version.

8.    If a TAF is issued internationally or by a U-S military base, it may have some differences.

  

## Closer Look: Get the Big Picture

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 13_

Aviation and weather go hand-in-hand so you must always focus on a quality weather briefing to make your flights safer.

### Review:

1.    Many pilots base the go/no go decision on little more than the latest radar image and some METAR reports. While these are important, a good weather briefing goes much deeper than this.

2.    A good weather briefing must include an understanding of weather systems and fronts.

3.    Lows are responsible for more bad weather than anything else, from low ceilings to in-flight icing.

4.    Get an idea of how weather systems and fronts are developing and moving to anticipate weather conditions.

5.    This big picture weather briefing doesn’t have to be time-consuming–in spite of what some flight instructors might say,

6.    A thorough understanding of the big picture can lead to easier go/no go decisions, fewer surprises en route and more comfortable flights.

  

## Introduction to Glass Cockpit Systems

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 14_

Most new aircraft manufactured today are equipped with digital flight instrumentation, commonly referred to as a glass cockpit. This section explores the most common system, the Garmin G1000, and the various components that allow it to function.

### Review:

1.    The screen on the left in front of the pilot is called the primary flight display (PFD) and depicts your flight instruments.

2.    The screen on the right is the multi function display (MFD), and depicts GPS, engine instruments, moving maps and other operational information.

3.    There are a number of "boxes", called line replaceable units (LRU) that control the various aspects of the G1000’s operation.

4.    An air data computer (ADC) processes information from the pitot/static system and the outside air temperature probe. This unit computes pressure altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, and OAT for display on the G1000.

5.    Replacing the traditional gyros, is a solid-state unit called the AHRS, standing for attitude and heading reference system. As the name implies, this computes aircraft attitude and heading information using advanced sensors, accelerometers, and rate sensors.

6.    An engine monitoring unit receives and processes signals from the engine and airframe sensors, providing digital readouts on the displays of all traditional engine instrumentation.

7.    The controls on the bezels are comprised of knobs, buttons, and softkeys and are identically positioned on both the PFD and the MFD.

8.    The twelve softkeys along the bottom of the bezel have various jobs depending on the system's operating mode. the same key could have different names and functions.

  

## Airport Signs and Markings

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 15_

Runway safety is an important issue in aviation. Elements of this will be emphasized on your practical test but it is pertinent to your everyday flying as well.

### Review:

1.    The FAA publishes an airport diagram for each airport with an air traffic control tower, showing the location and name of each parking area, taxiway and runway.

2.    A non-movement area is an area not controlled by ATC and you can taxi around as you’d like without an ATC clearance and is identified with two yellow lines, one solid and one dashed.

3.    A taxiway direction sign will feature a black letter on a yellow background, identifying the taxiway name, and an arrow pointing in the direction to get to the taxiway.

4.    The surface markings on a taxiway are yellow and include a solid stripe to identify the centerline, and double solid lines to identify the taxiway edges.

5.    Taxiway location signs indicate the taxiway on which you are located and include yellow text on a black background.

6.    Taxiway location signs indicate the taxiway on which you are located and include yellow text on a black background.

7.    Taxiways holding position marking may be on the ground for intersecting taxiways. This is a single dashed yellow line, and you must stop before this line if ATC instructs

8.    A yellow hold short marking painted on the taxiway surface designates the entrance to a runway.

9.    This consists of 4 yellow lines, two solid and two dashed, with the solid lines located on the taxiway side. You must receive a clearance from ATC before crossing the solid lines to cross or enter the runway.

10. In conjunction with the pavement holding position markings will be a runway holding position sign with a red background and a white number indicating the runway designation.

11. When a taxiway intersects a runway at a point other than at the runway threshold, the holding position sign will display the runway numbers for both directions.

12. Many airports include elevated or in-ground runway guard lights and flash alternating yellow lights.

13. A red sign with the letters ILS and a corresponding yellow marking on the taxiway identifies the critical area for the instrument landing system. You are only expected to hold short of this area when instructed to by ATC.

14. A red sign with the letters APCH, the runway number and the standard yellow four line hold-short pavement marking indicates the runway approach holding position and does not require an ATC clearance to cross.

  

15. A displaced threshold identified by white arrows in the center, leading up to a

10-foot-wide white threshold bar marking the beginning of the runway can be used for takeoffs in either direction, but not for landing.

16. A black sign with a white numeral next to a runway indicates runway distance remaining in thousands of feet.

  

## Closer Look: Phonetic Alphabet

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 16_

In this section, we investigate the use of the phonetic alphabet.

### Review:

1.    Aviation has its own version of the English language. Part of this is due to the use of the phonetic alphabet when speaking letters.

2.    For instance, Skylane 6-1-6-7-L, is spoken six, one, six, seven, lima. The “Lima”, spoken for the letter "L", is just one of 26 phonetic alphabet letters.

3.    The letters b, c, d, and e all have the same general sound. They are pronounced, bravo, charlie, delta, echo. The purpose is because several letters may sound very similar when spoken over a scratchy radio in a noisy cockpit.

4.    Nine is spoken niner because it can sound a lot like five.

  

## Thunderstorms and Convective Forecasts

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 17_

Thunderstorms are always to be respected and avoided. Thunderstorms will cause damage to airplanes and its occupants.

### Review:

1.    Three conditions are required to create a thunderstorm: unstable air, high moisture content, and a source of lift.

2.    Thunderstorms have a life cycle consisting of three stages: they start as cumulus clouds and consist entirely of updrafts. The mature stage begins when the first precipitation falls from the cloud and is characterized by both updrafts and downdrafts. In the mature stage, downdrafts grow in size and occupy the entire cell, and the thunderstorm starts to dissipate.

3.    As a note, steady state thunderstorms, which are along fronts and in pre-frontal squall lines, continually regenerate and are in all three stages simultaneously.

4.    Hazardous turbulence is present in all thunderstorms, with the strongest turbulence in the shear where updrafts and downdrafts meet. It can occur up to 20 miles from the thunderstorm.

5.    Downdrafts in a thunderstorm may exceed the climb performance of general aviation airplanes.

6.    As a hazard to aircraft, hail can be deadly.

7.    Hailstones are caused by ice particles making many trips in updrafts and downdrafts. They grow larger on each trip through the levels, picking up large amounts of liquid water.

8.    Lightning can cause temporary blindness, puncture the skin of the aircraft, and damage avionics. It is always present in a thunderstorm.

  

## Radar Imagery

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 18_

In this section we will discuss how weather radar functions and how pilots can use that information for improved flight planning and hazardous weather avoidance.

### Review:

1.    Areas of precipitation may bring reduced visibility and low ceilings. You may also find other adverse weather conditions such as thunderstorms, turbulence, icing and mountain obscuration.

2.    Radars transmit microwave signals into the atmosphere and then listen for return signals, or echoes.

3.    Most providers use the same NEXRAD data and have similar presentations.

4.    Each color on the radar map corresponds to a different level of reflectivity. Blue and light green are light precipitation; yellow and orange are moderate; red is heavy; and magenta is extreme.

5.    The gradient describes how quickly the colors move from green to red. A shallow gradient, where the distance between light and moderate echoes is large, often indicates a less severe cell. In contrast, a steep gradient, where the echoes quickly go from green to yellow to red, means a serious storm is developing.

6.    Typically, higher echo tops correspond to convective weather and strong updrafts.

7.    Cell movement is a useful guide to how a weather system or thunderstorm is developing. One way to view cell movement is to animate the radar image, which will show the last

5-10 radar images in order.

  

## Drag

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 19_

Aerodynamics is the branch of mechanics dealing with forces exerted by air in motion. In this section we will investigate drag – one of the four forces acting on an airplane.

### Review:

1.    Drag is produced by moving the airplane through the air, and is considered to act parallel to the relative wind and rearward. Drag has two components, induced drag and parasite drag.

2.    Induced drag is caused by generating lift, and parasite drag is caused by the airplane's movement through the air.

3.    At relatively low subsonic speeds, form drag increases approximately as the square of the speed. If airspeed is doubled, and other factors are not changed, the form drag quadruples.

4.    Skin friction drag can be somewhat reduced by flush riveting, smooth paint, and waxing.

5.    Another part of parasite drag is interference drag caused by the intersection of different parts of the airplane, especially the wings and the fuselage.

6.    Induced drag is a byproduct of lift.

7.    The wingtip vortex consists of an upward flow beyond the wingtip, and a downwash behind the trailing edge of the wing. This induced downwash is the source of induced drag and is not the same as the downwash needed to produce lift.

8.    Induced drag becomes larger as the angle of attack is increased.

9.    A way to minimize induced drag is to make the wings longer, like on a sailplane. Airplane designers call the ratio of the wing chord to wing length aspect ratio.

10.  As one of the four forces acting on an airplane, drag is an important factor not only for speed, but also for fuel consumption, landing distance, and takeoff performance.

11.  Flaps, and forward slips, cause a great amount of drag.

  

## Closer Look: Reducing Drag

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 20_

In this section, we investigate ways that various types of airplanes reduce drag.

### Review:

1.    Today’s high-performance airplanes need more than just big engines to deliver top end speed. The exterior must also be aerodynamically clean and create as little drag as possible.

2.    One of the best known aerial speedsters is the Cessna Citation Ten.

3.    Laminar flow swept wings provide high-speed performance high into the flight levels. The winglets reduce wingtip vortices to minimize induced drag and most forward facing surfaces, such as the wind shield, are swept back. The exterior surfaces are smooth to the touch, without any evidence of raised screws or rivets.

4.    Closer to home, Cirrus aircraft are known to be aerodynamically efficient and have a reputation for being some of the most modern single-engine production airplanes available.

5.    Cirrus has gone to great lengths to reduce drag everywhere possible in the design, starting with an advanced composite construction. The thin laminar flow wing significantly reduces skin-friction drag, while winglets located at the tips reduce wingtip vortices and associated induced drag. Gap seals around the ailerons aim to further reduce form drag on the wing.

6.    The front of the Cirrus is just as sleek, with a curved cowl designed around the engine and air inlets, plexiglass cover over the landing light and swept back windshield. Each wheel is covered with a teardrop-shaped fairing to further reduce form drag caused by the fixed landing gear.

7.    Now that you know what to look for, check around the airport for other examples of drag reduction on various makes and models of airplanes.

  

## Thrust, Stability & Center of Gravity

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 21_

In this section, we investigate thrust, stability of the airplane, and its center of gravity.

### Review:

1.    Thrust is a force just as lift, drag, and weight are forces. The strength of a force is measured in pounds. A force applied over a distance, is called work. The amount of work performed over a period of time is called power.

2.    Thrust is greatest as the airplane starts moving and reduces as it accelerates until thrust is equal to drag and airspeed becomes steady.

3.    In level flight, if thrust exceeds drag, speed will increase. Conversely, speed will decrease if drag is greater than thrust.

4.    Weight opposes lift. The weight of the airplane includes, crew, passengers, fuel, and baggage. Weight acts at the center of gravity – the point where the airplane would balance.

5.    Stability is the quality of an airplane to automatically return to its original flight attitude after being disturbed by an outside force.

6.    Too much stability makes the airplane less maneuverable. Not enough stability makes the airplane difficult to control. The pilot affects stability by the way the airplane is loaded.

7.    The center of gravity of most airplanes is positioned slightly in front of the center of lift, making the airplane nose heavy. This will help the airplane recover from a stall.

8.    To balance the nose heaviness, there is a down force on the tail. This is the result of propeller slipstream, down wash from the wing, and the angle at which the stabilizer meets the relative wind. Therefore, lift equals weight in steady unaccelerated flight.

9.    Lateral or roll stability is usually achieved by dihedral. Positive dihedral occurs when the wing tips are somewhat higher than the wing root.

10.  In a bank, the lowered wing has a higher angle of attack and produces more lift because of dihedral. This will return the airplane to a wings level position.

11.  Another aspect of weight and balance theory is yaw or vertical axis stability. It's a function of the side area of the fuselage and the size of the vertical stabilizer.

12.  The airplane will yaw around its center of gravity (CG). The side area of the fuselage and vertical stabilizer is greater aft of the CG, making the airplane weathervane back to its original direction.

13.  An aft center of gravity will reduce the area behind the CG. This makes the airplane somewhat less directionally stable.

14.  Improper loading of the airplane can affect the stability on all three axes, but has the greatest effect on longitudinal or pitch stability.

15.  The CG must fall within a certain range. On the Skyhawk for example, at maximum weight, this allowable range is 7.4 inches. Passengers, baggage, fuel, and other items

  

loaded in the airplane must be placed to keep it longitudinally balanced within these 7.4 inches.

16.  If the loaded center of gravity is aft of the allowable range, pitch stability will be reduced. Elevator control forces become lighter, and the airplane will tend to wander from level flight, pitching steeper up or down.

17.  Loaded this way, if stalled, the airplane would remain in the stalled pitch attitude.

18.  Loading the airplane with the center of gravity forward of the allowable range will increase longitudinal stability, calling for more elevator pressure to make pitch changes. In this situation, there might not be enough elevator control to flare for landing.

19.  A forward CG also results in a higher stall speed and lower performance in all areas.

20.  The weight of the airplane must not exceed its maximum allowable weight. This will cause higher stall speeds, longer takeoff distance, lower rate of climb, and a longer landing roll.

  

## Flight Service Weather Briefings

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 22_

In this section we'll look at the weather briefing services offered by Flight Service and how you can use this to supplement own personal weather briefing.

### Review:

1.    Flight service provides access to trained specialists who provide plain language preflight and in-flight weather briefings - often times with insight and local knowledge not found with commercial providers.

2.    You can reach the flight service station serving your area by dialing 1-800-WX-BRIEF.

3.    There are three types of preflight briefings available from flight service stations. The standard briefing is the most complete and is used when the pilot has not received a prior briefing. The abbreviated briefing is used to update a previous briefing, or used when the pilot only needs one or two specific items. An outlook briefing should be requested when the proposed flight time is six or more hours from the time of the briefing.

4.    When you call for a preflight weather briefing, identify yourself as a student pilot and give the briefer information concerning your proposed flight. Tell the briefer your name, airplane number, the airplane type, the departure airport, that the flight is for local dual instruction, and your proposed takeoff time.

5.    Many airports have computer access weather systems which are used for self-briefing.

  

## Closer Look: Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA)

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 23_

The GFA replaced the text-based Area Forecast and allows pilots to view a wealth of weather information, from TAFs and METARs to projections of turbulence and icing in a graphical form.

### Review:

6.    The GFA can be accessed from the Aviation Weather Center website ([www.aviationweather.gov)](http://www.aviationweather.gov/) and is presented on an interactive map.

7.    When you first load the GFA, you’ll see TAF information in surface plot map form.

8.    Click on one of the reporting points to see the latest METAR, and - if one is produced - the latest TAF for that site.

9.    Select the “CIG/VIS” button you’ll see the option to display a graphical representation of ceilings, flight categories, and visibilities. The default Flight Categories view provides a big picture view of VFR and IFR conditions across the U.S., similar to legacy Weather Depiction chart.

10. Select the “Clouds” button in the upper-level hand corner to review forecast cloud coverage, tops and bases. Use the “TOPS,” “COV,” or “BASE” buttons in the small menu on the left side of the map to switch between views.

11. The “PCPN/WX” layer will display weather and hazards for a given time.

12. The TS, or Thunderstorm layer, will display the forecast coverage of convection or thunderstorms at a given time.

13. The “Winds” layer on the GFA shows winds aloft forecast at various altitudes. You can adjust the flight level you want to review or display the maximum wind speed sampled across all altitudes for each point on the map.

14. The “Turb” (or Turbulence) and “Ice” (or icing) layers operate similar to the “Winds” section. The Turbulence layer is based on the eddy dissipation rate and shows forecast intensity based on the altitude selected on the left side of the screen.

15.  The Graphical Forecasts for Aviation or GFA tool is an excellent source of weather information during your flight briefing. Make it a point to check it out before each flight to supplement your self-weather briefings.

  

## Federal Aviation Regulations

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 24_

In this section, we investigate a portion of the federal aviation regulations.

### Review:

1.    There are seven categories of aircraft: airplanes, rotorcraft, powered-lift, gliders, lighter than air, weight-shift control, and powered parachute.

2.    These categories are subdivided by classes.

3.    Airplane classes are single-engine land, multiengine land, single-engine sea, and multiengine sea. Rotorcraft classes are helicopters and gyroplanes. Airships and free balloons are the lighter than air classes, while there are no class divisions for gliders, powered-lift, powered parachute or weight-shift control aircraft.

4.    The less maneuverable aircraft have the right-of-way. Airplanes, for example, must give way to everything except in an emergency. Aircraft that are towing or refueling another aircraft have the right-of-way over all other engine-driven aircraft.

5.    If aircraft are approaching head on each must change course to the right. If aircraft of the same category are converging, the aircraft to the right has the right-of-way.

6.    An aircraft being overtaken has the right-of-way. The overtaking aircraft shall alter course to the right and pass well clear.

7.    An aircraft landing or on final approach has the right-of-way over other aircraft. If two or more aircraft are approaching to land, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the

right-of-way.

8.    If in doubt, always yield the right-of-way. The rule is, see and avoid.

9.    You should continuously scan all areas of the sky for traffic.

10.  You can observe about two hundred degrees of the horizon. But only a small central area of the eye sends sharply focused messages to the brain. Scanning is the technique used to take advantage of the central visual area.

11.  Use a series of short spaced (about one second) eye movements covering each ten degree segment of the sky. For effective scanning, develop a pattern that is best for you.

12.  It's important to learn to divide your attention inside and outside the airplane. Your eyes require several seconds to refocus on objects in the distance after looking at the instrument panel.

13.  After a scan of the area, check the instruments inside. Then start the scan process over again. Give your eyes time to adjust to each situation.

14.  In a climb or descent, use gentle bank turns to see all around you.

15.  If an aircraft is above the horizon, it is probably at a higher altitude than you. An aircraft below your horizon is probably at a lower altitude.

16.  If an aircraft stays in one spot and does not appear to have any relative motion, it is likely on a collision course.

  

17.  In the practice area, clearing turns should precede all stalls, slow flight, and other training maneuvers.

18.  Also, remember to keep the windshield clean and use exterior lights during the day to make your airplane more conspicuous.

19.  If you experience radio failure at a towered airport, expect the tower to use light gun signals. If the transmitter is working, broadcast your intentions, and request light gun signals. If the receiver is working, monitor the tower frequency for instructions.

20.  If you are unable to receive instructions over the radio, join the airport traffic pattern, and look for light gun signals.

21.  Learn the light gun signals by heart.

  

## Air Facts: Eye to the Sky

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 25_

See and avoid is the foundation of flying safety.

### Review:

1.    You’ll learn about the concept of collision avoidance early on in your training, which is essentially the process of actively scanning for other aircraft.

2.    It’s important that you take on this responsibility as a student pilot early on in your training, and not assume that your instructor is the only one scanning for other airplanes.

3.    When it comes time to perform maneuvers like stalls or slow flight, make it a ritual to scan the airspace with clearing turns each and every time.

4.    If a potential traffic conflict arises, don’t get too caught up with right-of-way rules to the point that you freeze up and do nothing. Take the course of action that puts the most space between you and the other airplane.

5.    Collision avoidance is a matter of keeping up an active scan for other airplanes.

6.    The basic right-of-way rule is to see and avoid. You can argue the point on the ground if you wish.

7.    Day or night, use as many lights as possible to make yourself visible to other pilots.

8.    Technology is also playing an important role in collision avoidance. The NextGen air traffic control system includes a traffic component, that sends out the location of other airplanes via an electronic datalink.

9.    You must be equipped with 2 components to receive this traffic data: an ADS-B out transponder, and an ADS-B in receiver and display. The second half of the equation can be as simple as a portable ADS-B receiver and iPad.

10.  If you’re fortunate enough to fly with this traffic awareness technology, don’t allow it to lead you down the path of increased heads-down time in the cockpit staring at the screen. Instead take advantage of the audio alert features to get your attention if another airplane is nearby.

  

## Student Pilot & Medical Certificate

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 26_

In order to solo, you must obtain a student pilot certificate.

### Review:

1.    To get a student pilot certificate, you must be at least 16 years old, be able to read, speak, write, and understand English, and hold at least a 3rd class medical certificate.

2.    To obtain the medical certificate, you need to pass a physical given by an aviation medical examiner.

3.    A third class medical certificate is good for 60 calendar months if you haven't reached your 40th birthday, and 24 calendar months if you've already turned 40.

4.    Calendar months go to the end of the month.

5.    For pilots who only require a third class medical - essentially all non-commercial flying, you may be able to operate under Basic Med rules as long as you’ve obtained at least one FAA medical at any point after July 14, 2006 and hold a valid U.S. driver’s license.

6.    When flying under basic med rules, a maximum of five passengers may be carried. and the aircraft may not be certified with more than six seats or for more than six thousand pounds. Pilots are restricted to operations below 18,000 feet and limited to a maximum speed of 250 knots.

7.    In lieu of renewing an FAA medical with an aviation medical examiner, under basic med, pilots must visit their primary care physician – or any state licensed physician - at least once every four years.

8.    Pilots are also required to complete an online training course in aeromedical factors every two years which is available at no charge from the aircraft owners and pilots association.

9.    Hypoxia is a lack of sufficient oxygen which can impair brain function. High altitudes cause hypoxia because of the reduced atmospheric pressure there – less O2.

10.  The nature of hypoxia makes it hard for you to judge when it occurs. The first symptoms of oxygen deficiency are usually pleasant, called euphoria.

11.  Hypoxia results in impairment of judgment, memory, alertness, and coordination. Headaches, drowsiness, or dizziness are likely.

12.  Flights up to 10,000 feet without supplemental oxygen can be considered safe for most healthy people.

13.  The FARs require the use of supplemental oxygen after 30 minutes above 12,500 feet MSL.

14.  Carbon monoxide is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas caused by engine combustion. If you notice engine exhaust fumes, CO is probably present. Close the heater vents and open the outside air vents.

  

15.  CO reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, causing drowsiness, dizziness, or headaches.

16.  Hyperventilation occurs when an abnormal volume of air is breathed in and out of the lungs. It can be caused by breathing too rapidly as a result of stress or anxiety. You are depleting the CO2 in your system.

17.  The symptoms of hyperventilation are dizziness, nausea, tingling of the hands, legs and feet, drowsiness, and in some instances, unconsciousness.

18.  To eliminate hyperventilation you can talk in a normal tone and speed or breathe in and out of a paper bag.

19.  As a pilot, you can experience various illusions in flight that can contribute to landing errors.

20.  For example, a runway that is narrower than usual can create the illusion that the airplane is higher than it actually is resulting in a lower approach. A runway wider than usual can have the opposite effect.

21.  An upsloping runway can create the illusion that the airplane is higher than it actually is, possibly resulting in an approach that is too low. A downsloping runway has the opposite effect.

22.  There are also illusions caused by water, featureless terrain, rain on the windshield, or atmospheric haze.

  

## Air Facts: Fit for Flight

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 27_

The FAA physical is designed to uncover any of the disqualifying conditions covered by the regulations. It's good to go beyond the rules though; because there are a lot of other factors that make it unwise to go flying.

### Review:

1.    A simple cold, accompanied by head stuffiness, can aggravate ear problems as you ascend and descend and the general miserable feeling can be a major distraction.

2.    You shouldn't fly if you are taking any medicine unless you discussed it with the medical examiner and he okays it for flying. Even a simple antihistamine can make you groggy.

3.    You have to decide if you feel good enough to fly. If whatever you are experiencing is such that you can't concentrate on the task at hand, don't fly.

4.    Excessive fatigue could also be a good reason not to fly.

5.    The FARs say no flying within 8 hours of consuming alcohol, or with a blood alcohol level of .04 or greater. Use common sense here. If you are not recovered after 8 hours, don't fly.

  

## Solo

_Private Pilot Chapter 3 – Video Segment 28_

The FARs require that student pilots complete a written examination prior to solo. It must be given, graded, and incorrect answers reviewed by the instructor who endorses your student pilot certificate and logbook for solo flight.

### Review:

1.    The written covers regulations, airspace rules, and procedures for the airport where the solo flight is to be performed, as well as characteristics and operational limitations for the make and model of aircraft flown.

2.    Know the limitations of the student pilot certificate.

3.    To fly solo, you must have your logbook, photo I-D, student pilot and medical certificate readily available in the aircraft or in your possession.

4.    Your logbook must be endorsed by the instructor who gave the flight instruction within 90 days of solo.

5.    To solo an airplane, you must have received flight instruction in that make and model of airplane within the preceding 90 days.

6.    You may not fly solo contrary to any limitations such as wind speed, ceiling, or visibility placed in your logbook by the instructor.

7.    You may not carry passengers or fly an airplane that is carrying property for compensation or hire. You cannot be a pilot flight crew member of an aircraft which requires two pilots. You cannot be a pilot for compensation or hire or in furtherance of a business.

8.    For solo flights, the surface or flight visibility must be at least 3 statute miles during daylight hours and at least 5 statute miles at night.

9.    You may not fly beyond a radius of 25 nautical miles of your home base without a specific endorsement.

10.  As you earn your solo privileges, you will take on increased responsibilities. For example, landing at other airports within your 25 mile radius.

11.  You are now responsible for your own safety and that of others. You are now accountable regarding the applicable FARs.

12.  Prior to your first solo, your flight instructor will be making fewer corrections and may seem to be more of a passenger than an instructor. One day, after making some takeoffs and landings, you will be told to taxi back to the ramp. He will endorse your pilot certificate and logbook and tell you to do a few takeoffs and landings on your own.

13.  The most noticeable difference will be how quiet the cabin is without the instructor.
