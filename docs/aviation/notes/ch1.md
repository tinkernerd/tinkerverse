2.    After earning your certificate you’ll be able to take local flights on nice days to soar above familiar locations and find new and interesting places.

3.    Sporty's Learn to Fly Course includes lifetime access, and you can access the training online, on iPhone/iPad, Android devices and on smart TV apps.

4.    After launching the course, proceed right to the video training section of course the to get started.

5.    We recommend watching all the videos in order, from start to finish. The online, app and TV platforms continuously sync your progress, so feel free to switch between them.

6.    After completing several of the video training chapters and when you begin to feel comfortable with the training content, head over to the Test Prep section of the course to begin studying questions and preparing for the FAA knowledge test.

7.    After studying each category group at least once, you can move on to the advanced study modes and begin taking simulated practice tests. You can take as many practice tests as you’d like, and your top two scores will always be shown in the progress tracker.

8.    As you progress through flight training at the airport, you’ll want to reference the Flight Maneuvers guide to prepare for the upcoming tasks in each lesson.

9.    You’ll find additional study resources in the FAA Handbooks section, and a complete digital copy of the Federal Aviation Regulations, or FARs.

10. Finally, you’ll want to use the training tools in the Checkride Prep section of the course towards the end of your training as you prepare for the oral and flight test with an FAA examiner.

  

## When Should You Fly?

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 2_

Flying is challenging, interesting, and downright fun. Before your flight lesson, you must make an important decision – whether to fly today or not. This is commonly referred to as the go/no-go decision. Even though at this stage of your education your flight instructor will help you make this decision, it’s important that you learn to analyze conditions for yourself. The decision is made based on several factors. One of the most important factors is the existing weather conditions.

### Review:

1.    Before ever leaving the ground, each pilot must make an important decision. Whether to fly or not, commonly referred to as the go / no-go decision. And even though you're a student pilot, the operative word is pilot, and you, along with your instructor, should make this decision each lesson based on several factors, among these factors is weather.

2.    Anytime of the year can be a great time to fly. Summer's warm weather typically offers many flyable days. But summer storms are not to be trifled with and are always a reason to delay a flight if they are near. Winter typically offers the clearest air of the four seasons, and since cold air is more dense than warm air, aircraft performance is at its peak.

3.    Visibility is another factor to consider – three miles is the lowest practical visibility.

4.    Be aware of the wind. Even clear days could have difficult wind conditions beyond your ability.

5.    The type and amount of cloud cover must also be analyzed. Visual flight rules specify a minimum ceiling height of 1,000 feet above the ground.

6.    Clouds may become a ceiling that you can’t legally penetrate. A ceiling is the lowest cloud layer that covers most of the sky. If it’s solid, it’s called overcast. A broken ceiling is simply an overcast with a few holes in it.

7.    As you begin training, you’ll fly mostly during the day. Later, you’ll enjoy learning to fly at night.

  

## Air Facts: Weather Geeks

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 3_

One of the really great things about learning to fly is the new relationship you’ll develop with the study of weather. You’ll acquire a knowledge of highs, lows, and fronts and how these phenomena affect weather patterns.

### Review:

1.    Many pilots either watch the morning TV shows, browse online or check their favorite aviation app to get an idea of what the synopsis is going to be that day.

2.    Make a practice to study the weather daily. Decide for yourself if today is a good day to fly or not based on your observations. Later, you can compare your conclusions with the actual results of the day.

3.    Forecasting, especially forecasting more than a few hours ahead of time, is not an exact science. That's why a real pilot is what you might call a weather geek. We’re always checking the latest forecast and report on our mobile device and comparing it to what we see out the window.

4.    You can’t learn enough about weather patterns. Keep up with your study of weather even after attaining your Recreational or Private Pilot Certificate.

5.    Always respect the weather.

  

## Introduction to the Airplane

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 4_

In this section you will investigate the various aspects of the airplane – its controls, and the aerodynamics that make it fly.

### Review:

1.    There are four forces that act on an airplane in flight – lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Lift is the force that acts upward, against gravity. Thrust propels the airplane forward, and drag acts opposite of thrust.

2.    A Swiss mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli, found that, as the speed of the air increases, its pressure will decrease.

3.    The upper surface of a wing is curved and the lower surface is relatively flat. As air flow meets the wing, the air flowing over the top curve, or camber, increases speed decreasing the pressure on top of the wing. This decreased pressure is the major source of the lift needed to make the airplane fly.

4.    The front part of a wing is called the leading edge and the back is called the trailing edge. In cross section, an imaginary line drawn between the leading edge and the trailing edge is called the wing chord.

5.    An airplane has three axis of movement – the longitudinal axis which passes through the length of the airplane, the lateral axis which passes through the wings, and the vertical axis, which passes through the body of the airplane perpendicular to the other two axes.

6.    To maneuver an airplane you must control its movement around these three axes. This is done by moving the primary control surfaces – the elevator, ailerons, and rudder.

7.    Ailerons control roll, pitch is controlled by the elevator, and the rudder controls yaw.

8.    Pulling the yoke back moves the elevator to rotate the airplane around the lateral axis pitching the nose up. Pushing the yoke forward pitches the nose down.

9.    Turning the control yoke moves the ailerons. Turn it right, right aileron is up and the left one is down, and the airplane banks right. Move the control yoke left and the left aileron is up and the right one is down, banking the airplane to the left. The bank will normally continue to increase until the ailerons are returned to the neutral position.

10. Pushing the right rudder pedal moves the rudder to the right and the airplane’s nose yaws to the right. Push the left rudder, and the nose goes left. Yawing the nose is not necessarily turning the airplane.

11. In turning flight, the rudder's function is to counteract adverse yaw which occurs when the airplane is rolled into a turn and when it's rolled back to wings level flight.

12. A trim tab is used to relieve the pressure needed to hold a primary control surface out of the streamlined position. In many cases, elevator trim can be adjusted in flight. In some airplanes it can only be adjusted on the ground.

  

13. The flaps are the movable panels on the trailing edge of the inboard parts of the wings. Both flaps are extended and retracted at the same time. Lowering the flaps increases both lift and drag.

14. Extending the flaps allows the landing approach to be steeper and slower. In some situations flaps are also used to shorten the takeoff run.

  

## Closer Look: Training Airplanes

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 5_

There are various models of airplane commonly used for training.

### Review:

1.    The Cessna 152 is a high-wing, 2-place trainer that cruises around 95 knots.

2.    The larger 4-place 172, also known as a Skyhawk, will cruise around 120 knots.

3.    The 152 and 172 are the most common trainers around.

4.    The Diamond D-A-20 is a two seat trainer of composite construction. The D-A 20 will cruise about 120 to 130 knots. The four seat Diamond D-A-40 cruises at 130 to 150 knots depending on the model.

5.    Moving up, the Cirrus SR20 and 22 are four seat composite airplanes with much higher cruise speeds. These aircraft have an airframe parachute available for use in emergencies.

6.    Another traditional choice is the PA28 series from Piper. This family of airplanes includes the Warrior and the Archer. They both have an endurance of about 4 hours.

7.    There are a number of light sport training airplanes available. These aircraft have no more than two seats, are subject to airspeed and weight limits, and have been tested and approved under a different set of regulations than traditional airplanes. Recreational and private students can train in these LSAs subject to the limitations imposed on the aircraft.

8.    Popular models include the Flight Design CTLS, Cessna Skycatcher, Tecnam, and Vans RV 12.

  

## Introduction to the Cockpit

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 6_

In this section we will move inside the cockpit and take a look at the flight instruments and the rest of the airplane panel. Most training airplanes have fully functioning dual controls and can be flown from either side. Traditionally, the pilot flies the airplane from the left.

### Review:

1.    The instrument panel is roughly divided into 3 areas. On the left are the flight, navigation and engine instruments, electrical switches and circuit breakers. The radios, engine controls, fuel controls, flaps and trim, are positioned in the middle. On the right are the cabin environment controls, hour meter, and space for options.

2.    The flight instruments are the airspeed indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter, vertical speed indicator, turn coordinator, and heading indicator, also called the directional gyro.

3.    The airspeed indicator is typically marked in nautical miles per hour, called knots for short. A nautical mile equals 1.15 statute miles. To convert a distance in nautical miles to statute miles multiply nautical miles by 1.15. For example, ten nautical miles equals 11.5 statute miles.

4.    The airspeed indicator is color coded. The speed marked by the red line should never be exceeded. You should only fly at airspeeds in the yellow arc in smooth air. The green arc denotes the normal operating airspeed range. The white arc is the flaps operating range.

5.    The vertical speed indicator measures the rate of climb, or descent, in feet per minute. The altimeter measures the altitude, or height, of the airplane above sea level.

6.    An altimeter has three hands, just like a clock. The fastest moving hand, which looks like a minute hand, is the hundreds of feet hand. The short hand reads in thousands of feet and the longest hand, which moves the slowest, indicates tens of thousands of feet.

7.    The altimeter reading is based on barometric pressure, and barometric pressure is constantly changing. Therefore, the altimeter must be set prior to every flight to field elevation before takeoff.

8.    The attitude indicator is a gyroscopic instrument. The miniature airplane pitches and banks around the horizon bar the same way your training airplane pitches and banks around the natural horizon.

9.    The magnetic compass is located away from metal and electrical wiring to reduce the effect of local magnetic fields. It is a very useful instrument but has some peculiarities that you will learn about later.

10. The heading indicator, not the compass, is the principle direction instrument used in flight. Because the heading indicator is gyroscopically stabilized, it's not affected by banks, turns, and speed changes. However, the heading indicator must be set to the compass indication before takeoff and periodically adjusted to the compass indication while the airplane is in steady, level flight.

  

11. The turn coordinator, a gyroscopic instrument, provides information about the direction and rate of the turn. The ball, or inclinometer, which is under the turn coordinator, shows the quality of the turn based on the proper balance of the forces acting on the airplane. If everything is balanced, the ball will remain centered.

12. The power setting is shown on the tachometer, which indicates the revolutions per minute of the engine and is marked to indicate the maximum permissible RPM of the engine.

13. The engine controls begin with the throttle, which is like the accelerator pedal on a car. Push it forward to increase power and pull it back to decrease power. The throttle friction lock adjusts the ease with which the throttle can be moved and can lock the throttle in one position so it doesn’t move.

14. Some airplane engines have a mixture control to regulate the ratio of gasoline to air entering the fuel distribution system. Push forward to enrich, and pull back to lean the amount of fuel in relationship to the amount of air entering the carburetor.

15. The oil pressure and temperature gauges are used to monitor engine operation and the fuel flow gauge monitors fuel flow in gallons per hour.

16. The flap control generally indicates the position of the flaps.

17. The elevator trim control wheel is rotated forward for nose down trim, aft, for nose up trim.

18. The vacuum gauge enables the pilot to check the operation of the engine driven vacuum pump.

19. The fuel selector allows the pilot to draw fuel from both tanks simultaneously or either tank individually. In some airplanes, you have only an on/off arrangement.

20. Spend some time on your own sitting in the airplane learning the position of the switches, instruments, and gauges.

  

## Closer Look: Cockpit Variations

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 7_

Depending on the model airplane, the cockpit can be quite varied in its layout and arrangement.

### Review:

1.    Beginning with the engine controls, the throttle and mixture control may be levers instead of push/pull knobs.

2.    High wing Cessnas, with carbureted engines, don’t have fuel pumps. The fuel is gravity-fed from the wings.

3.    The fuel selector in many Pipers can draw fuel from either the left or right tanks – not both simultaneously. The 152's fuel control, located between the seats, has only an on/off position, and fuel is always drawn from both tanks at the same time.

4.    Many electrical system master switches are divided in two – one for the battery and one for the alternator.

5.    Some of the most dramatic cockpit variations are found in the electronic instrument panels used in some airplanes. These glass cockpit equipped airplanes have digital computer displays which replace the traditional analog instruments.

6.    You will learn how to calculate a number of important performance numbers related to your speed through the air and over the ground. Modern glass cockpits do many of these calculations automatically.

7.    Engine instruments can be found on the multifunction display, along with a large GPS-driven moving map. The GPS map makes it easy to keep track of your position, and provides quick information on nearby airports and airspace.

8.    A glass cockpit equipped airplane can provide a lot of information. However, the time required to master these systems may be a consideration when deciding on your training aircraft.

9.    Remember, your eyes need to spend most of their time looking outside.

  

## Introduction to Airplane Engines

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 8_

In this section we investigate the typical training airplane engine. Most training airplanes use four-stroke, internal combustion, reciprocating engines which operate on the same principle as automobile engines. A reciprocating engine converts the back and forth motion of the pistons to the rotary motion of the crankshaft.

### Review:

1.    There are six basic parts of an airplane’s engine – cylinders, pistons which are inside the cylinders, valves at the top of each cylinder, connecting rods linking the piston to the crankshaft, and the crankcase, which is the metal engine frame.

2.    Each cylinder has two spark plugs for improved combustion and as a safety backup.

3.    There are five events that occur in the cycle of a four-stroke engine:

1.    During the intake stroke, the piston is moving in toward the crankshaft and the intake valve is open, allowing the fuel air mixture to flow into the cylinder.

2.    As the piston starts moving out, away from the crankshaft, both valves are closed and the fuel/air mixture is compressed in the cylinder. This stroke is called the compression stroke.

3.    As the piston nears the end of its outward travel, the fuel air mixture is ignited and the rapid burning and expansion of the fuel pushes the piston toward the crankshaft in the power stroke.

4.    During the exhaust stroke, the last stroke in the cycle, the piston moves out and the exhaust valve is opened and the burned gasses are forced out of the cylinder.

5.    As a cylinder is undergoing this cycle, the other cylinders are each going through different parts of the cycle. No matter how many cylinders an engine has, each of the cylinders will complete the cycle every time the crankshaft makes two revolutions.

4.    In burning the fuel/air mixture, heat is produced, most of which is evacuated through the exhaust system.

5.    Most airplane engines are air cooled. Baffles guide the airflow to the heat critical parts of the engine. The cylinders have cooling fins which increase the effectiveness of the air flow. The air enters the front of the engine compartment, passes over the baffled fins, and exits through the rear of the engine cowling.

6.    Engine lubricating oil performs three functions – it coats the surfaces of all moving parts with a slick film, it dissipates heat as it circulates through the oil cooler, and third, it carries any foreign materials to the oil filter.

7.    Airplane engines have a two magneto ignition system. The magnetos power the spark plugs which ignite the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders. The magnetos allow the engine to

  

run independently of the airplane's battery and electrical system. It is one of the redundancies built into the airplane for safety.

8.    The ignition switch in the cockpit has five positions – off, right, left, both, and start. With the switch in the left or right position the engine is running on only one of the magnetos and only one set of spark plugs. When the switch is placed in the both position both magnetos are supplying ignition and all spark plugs are firing. During engine run-up you'll check both magnetos to be sure they're operating correctly.

  

## Air Facts: Engine TLC

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 9_

This section discusses the need to develop a healthy respect for your airplane’s engine.

### Review:

1.    Engines need tender loving care to perform at their best. For example, use smooth throttle movements

2.    – don’t jam it in and yank it out.

3.    Gradual engine temperature changes are best. For example, after starting, especially in cold weather, let the engine run for a minute or so before using a lot of power to start taxiing.

4.    Aircraft engines are reliable and economical.

  

## Propeller, Fuel and Electrical System

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 10_

In this section we continue a discussion of airplane systems – most specifically, propeller, fuel, and electrical.

### Review:

1.    The fuel tanks on present day light training airplanes are located in the wings and are filled through openings in the top of the wing and covered by caps.

2.    Fuel lines carry the fuel from the tanks to the rest of the fuel system. The fuel caps are vented permitting air to replace the fuel consumed during flight.

3.    A fuel vent is located under the wing allowing for expansion of fuel caused by warm temperature. Some fuel dripping from this vent, with full fuel and hot weather, is normal.

4.    Airplanes have fuel drain valves located on the bottom of each wing. This allows you to draw fuel samples to check for water, sediment, and proper fuel octane – fuel grades are color coded. Aviation gasoline is colored blue and rated at 100 octane.

5.    You'll also find drain valves at the lowest point in the fuel selector, fuel reservoir, and fuel strainer. Contaminants can accumulate here.

6.    Jet fuel is clear or straw colored and smells like kerosene. At some airports, automobile gasoline called MOGAS is sold for aircraft use. MOGAS can only be used if your airplane is specifically approved for it.

7.    Fuel flows by gravity from the two wing tanks to a selector valve, into a reservoir tank, and then through the electric auxiliary fuel pump and so forth until it is injected into each cylinder.

8.    The electric fuel pump is operated and controlled by the pilot from a switch on the instrument panel. It is normally used to prime the engine before starting.

9.    The propeller is simply a rotating airfoil. When the propeller is turning it produces thrust in much the same way as a wing produces lift.

10. A propeller is twisted so it can produce equal thrust from the hub to the tip and pull the airplane through the air.

11. Most training airplanes are equipped with a fixed pitch propeller that provides the best compromise between climb and cruise for the engine and airframe combination. It can't be changed by the pilot.

12. The throttle enables the pilot to control the RPM of the engine and thus the power output – basically, the more RPM the more power.

13. The electrical system is used to power the engine starter, instruments, lights, and radio equipment. The battery is the heart of the system.

14. Once the engine has started an engine driven alternator supplies direct current to the system plus maintains a charge on the battery.

  

15. The master switch turns on the electrical system and supplies energy to all electric circuits except the ignition.

16. Circuit breakers are used to safeguard electrical equipment.

17. The ammeter measures the performance of the entire electrical system. A positive reading shows the system is working.

  

## Closer Look: Carbureted Engines

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 11_

In this section we continue a discussion of the operational differences in engines that you may find in your training aircraft – especially regarding the primer, carb heat, and mixture control.

### Review:

1.    Many carbureted engines have a fuel primer, which puts fuel directly into the engine cylinders. This makes it easier to start in cold weather. After using a primer, be sure it is closed and locked before attempting flight.

2.    Many carbureted light sport airplanes use a choke control for cold starting rather than a primer.

3.    Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing. The temperature of the fuel/air mixture in the venturi can drop as much as seventy degrees Fahrenheit, changing the water vapor to ice inside the carburetor. This causes lower power and eventually engine stoppage.

4.    Carburetor icing is most likely to form when there is high humidity or visible moisture with temperatures below seventy degrees Fahrenheit. On engines with fixed pitch propellers, the sign of carburetor icing is a gradual reduction of RPM.

5.    The solution to carb ice is to apply carburetor heat. This increases the engine intake air temperature. The heated air melts the ice that has formed and stops further ice formation.

6.    If there is no carburetor ice, you will notice a slight drop in engine RPM only.

7.    If you suspect carburetor ice, use full carburetor heat immediately. The engine will run somewhat rough with a further drop in RPM as the melted ice, enters the cylinders. After the ice is cleared, the RPM will increase.

8.    Some engines provide an automatic mixture control. The size of the venturi is automatically adjusted to maintain optimum conditions.

9.    Some fuel injected engines automatically adjust the output of the fuel pump to maintain an appropriate fuel air mixture.

  

## Air Facts: Purposeful Preflight

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 12_

In this section we discuss the importance of a good preflight inspection.

### Review:

1.    You’ll do a complete preflight before every flight. It’s extremely important – neither neglect it nor let it become a mindless ritual.

2.    In cold weather dress properly for the preflight. You don't want to rush through just because it's cold outdoors.

3.    The preflight will be more enjoyable if you consider it as part of flying. Not just an initial annoyance.

4.    Think about the flying surfaces and what they do as you inspect the airplane. What's the purpose of the Pitot tube, and the static vents, and the stall warning vane? If you think about what the Pitot tube does – provide information for airspeed indication – you won't likely leave the cover on.

5.    If you make your preflight a thinking session about each part of the airplane, the experience becomes much more constructive.

  

## Preflight

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 13_

In this section we investigate the preflight inspection. We conduct it every time before we fly to ensure that all systems are working properly and that enough fuel and oil is on board. Our preflight is based on the Cessna 172.

### Review:

1.    The preflight is your chance to look the airplane over and assure yourself that it's ready to fly. Once you're airborne you can't pull over in an emergency.

2.    The preflight begins as you approach the airplane. Look at its general appearance for such items as fuel or oil leaks, flat or underinflated struts and tires, snow, ice or other obstructions on or near the airplane. After this general overview, it's time to become specific.

3.    To conduct the preflight, use a written checklist.

4.    During the preflight keep an eye out for items that look different or out of the ordinary. You are looking for dented, cracked or wrinkled surfaces, loose or missing rivets and screws, and the like.

5.    Take care when examining control surfaces, antennas, and other parts. Don’t slam them against the stops.

6.    Make sure the required documents are on board. These include the airworthiness certificate, registration, operating limitations, and weight and balance information. The airworthiness certificate is required to be displayed so you can see it.

7.    Remove the control lock and turn the master switch on. Check the fuel quantity gauges and remember the amount of fuel for later when you visually check the tanks. The low fuel annunciator lights should be off.

8.    Switch the avionics master to ON and listen for the cooling fan – then turn it OFF.

9.    In most airplanes, check the operation of the flaps by lowering them all the way.

10.  Turn on the exterior lights and quickly make sure they're all working. Having completed the check of the electrical system, turn the master switch OFF. In most airplanes, the fuel selector valve should be on BOTH, and the fuel shutoff valve should be ON. The seat stop bolts should be in place and secure.

11.  For the exterior inspection, begin on the left side and proceed around the entire airplane in logical order. When checking the movable panels, don’t forget to look at the hinges, cotter pins, and the like.

12.  Look at the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and beacon.

13.  Don’t forget to check the fuel sumps on the wings and the bottom of the engine cowling.

14.  Observe the gear and tires and check the oil.

15.  You want to do the preflight the same way every time, using your checklist, to ensure that you haven’t missed anything.

  

## Engine Start

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 14_

In this section we investigate the engine startup procedure for a Cessna 172. As a safety note, make sure no person, structure, or airplane is behind you.

### Review:

1.    Set the parking brake and be ready to use the foot brakes should the parking brake not hold.

2.    Be sure the seats are adjusted and the seat belts buckled.

3.    If your training airplane is a 172, the fuel selector valve should be on BOTH and the fuel shutoff valve pushed all the way in – the ON position.

4.    Check that the circuit breakers are in and the avionics master switch is OFF, open the throttle about a quarter of an inch, confirm the mixture control is in the idle/cut-off position, and turn on the beacon switch.

5.    Turn on the master switch, clear the prop, activate the electric fuel pump, and advance the mixture control until the fuel flow shows 3 to 5 gallons per hour, then pull the mixture to the idle/cut-off position.

6.    Turn off the auxiliary fuel pump, turn the key to start, and when the engine starts release it. Advance the mixture control smoothly to full rich and check for proper oil pressure.

7.    Turn on the avionics' master, raise the flaps, and activate any additional necessary lighting.

  

## Aviation Communications

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 15_

English is the international language of aviation, but the words and phrases used can be confusing to beginners. You are learning a new language. Be patient – it takes practice.

### Review:

1.    The Aeronautical Information Manual is the official source for good radio communication procedures.

2.    The Pilot-Controller Glossary, often found in the back of the AIM, defines many of the common words and phrases that are used in the world of aviation

3.    There is a proper way to pronounce the letters of the alphabet and numerals on the radio, use the phonetic alphabet constructed by ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organization. The full list of alphabet and numeral phonetics can be found in the Aeronautical Information Manual.

4.    Most of the individual numerals are pronounced the same way you would pronounce them in a non-aviation setting. A few use a special pronunciation to ensure clarity over the radio. Nine is pronounced niner, five should sound like fife, and three is articulated as tree.

5.    Altitudes, ceiling heights, and other large numbers are indicated as hundreds and thousands in round numbers. A ceiling height of ninety-five hundred feet would be indicated as "niner thousand fife hundred."

6.    For numbers at or higher than ten thousand feet, you should pronounce the individual digits for the thousands and hundreds if appropriate. When reporting an altitude of twelve thousand five hundred, say "one two thousand fife hundred."

7.    While VFR operations are not permitted, altitudes above eighteen thousand feet are indicated as a flight level. Each digit of the flight level is pronounced when on the radio. Twenty-three thousand feet would be spoken as "flight level two tree zero."

8.    The individual digits of a radio frequency should also be enunciated. The decimal point should be spoken as "point"; for example, "one two two point one."

9.    The three digits of a bearing, course, heading, or wind direction should be spoken individually. Directions on the radio are in relation to magnetic unless the word "true" is added to the transmission.

10.  Time may be expressed as Coordinated Universal Time or in the local time zone. The use of the "zulu" description may be used but is not required. The word "local" or the time zone equivalent would be used to denote when the time is not UTC.

11.  As a general rule, most other numbers are transmitted by pronouncing each digit. An exception to this is in the description of airways used in IFR flying. Here V12 is pronounced "Victor twelve."

12.  Another exception would be for ATC traffic position reports. These are given in reference to the clock face.

  

13.  ATC traffic reports are in relation to the track rather than the nose of the airplane because radar does not show your crab angle.

14.  Words like Roger and Affirmative are not interchangeable. Each has a unique meaning in radio communications. "Roger" means that I have received all of your last transmission. It should not be used to answer a question requiring a yes or a no answer. "Affirmative" and "Negative" are used for yes and no, respectively.

15.  Wilco is similar in meaning to Roger. "Wilco" means I have received your message, understand it, and "will comply" with it.

16.  Most training airplanes are noisy and you'll be concentrating on flying. Using a headset will make the communications much clearer and also give you the benefit of hearing protection.

17.  The cockpit can be a loud place with all the engine and wind noise. To assure you're heard clearly over the extraneous sounds, position the microphone close to your lips, press the push-to-talk button and speak in a normal, but firm voice.

18.  The person you're talking to is a human being. If you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world. Simply correct yourself and go on with your message.

19.  Remember the four W's of radio communication: who you are calling, who you are, where you are, and what you want.

20.  The proper way to initiate communication with ATC is to give your location, aircraft type, altitude, what you want to do, and if you have ATIS.

21.  Try to eliminate unnecessary words like, 'ah', 'this is', 'at', and 'over'.

22.  If the frequency is very busy, shorten your initial contact to save frequency congestion. Once acknowledged by the controller, complete the rest of the W's.

23.  UNICOM is a non-government radio station. UNICOM is an acronym for unified communications, and it's available at most airports which do not have a control tower.

24.  You can request airport advisory information on the UNICOM frequency. Calls to UNICOM are made by using the airport name and the word UNICOM. For example "Clermont UNICOM." You should be aware that a UNICOM station is not always attended.

25.  The generic term for the radio channel to use at airports without an operating control tower is common traffic advisory frequency. The CTAF is indicated on aeronautical charts and other publications At a non-tower field, the four W's are still used on initial contact.

  

## Air Facts: Getting the Message

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 16_

Aviation jargon is terse, hardly conversational, and managing communications properly is a sign of a developing pro.

### Review:

1.    Pick up an air band receiver or scanner and listen to pilots communicate. If you are in a good geographical location you will be able to hear both sides of the communication. Search online for free ATC communications – listen and learn.

2.    Purchase a comfortable headset with microphone – it’s worth its weight in gold.

3.    Practice communicating in your mind in the various situations you might find yourself. Set various scenarios and perfect the verbiage.

4.    At a Towered Airport, you will first contact ground control.

5.    An initial contact to ground might go something like this, “Hagerstown ground, Cessna Four Zero Romeo Charlie at the T-hangars, ready to taxi, we have information Romeo.”

6.    Listen well before you speak. If you don’t understand something, ask for an explanation. Try not to step on another pilot’s transmission.

7.    At a busy place you’ll be constantly reminded that saying your message in as few words as possible is a real piloting virtue, one that convinces everyone that you do indeed have the right stuff.

  

## Taxi, Run-up, Traffic Pattern

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 17_

Your instructor will probably have you taxi the airplane on your first lesson. Safe ground operations involve the coordinated use of the throttle, control yoke, and foot pedals. Steering with your feet is going to take some getting used to.

### Review:

1.    Airplanes with tricycle landing gear are easier to taxi since they have a steerable nose wheel linked to the rudder pedals. Conventional gear airplanes are a bit more difficult because of the small size and placement of the tail wheel.

2.    To brake, press the top part of the rudder pedals with your toes. The right pedal controls the brake on the right wheel, and the left pedal, the left brake.

3.    To make a normal right turn, push on the right foot pedal. To turn left, push on the left pedal.

4.    To make a sharp right turn, for example, apply full right pedal, and add some right brake.

5.    It takes more power to begin taxiing than to keep the airplane moving. The engine throttle should be advanced slowly until the airplane begins to move, then the power should be reduced once you're under way.

6.    Test the brakes during the first several feet of taxiing to be sure they're working properly.

7.    Rest your heels on the floor to keep from riding the brakes.

8.    For control, taxi no faster than a brisk walk.

9.    Strong winds can get under the upwind wing and tip the airplane.

10. Move the ailerons fully to the right in a right quartering headwind and to the left, in a left quartering headwind. Keep the elevator neutral.

11. Taxiing with a left quartering tailwind, move the ailerons fully right and push the control wheel forward. Taxiing with a right quartering tailwind, move the ailerons fully left and push the control wheel forward.

12. On reaching the run-up area, head the airplane into the wind and don’t get too close to other airplanes.

13. Follow your before-takeoff checklist. Seats set and locked, belts on. Doors and windows closed and locked. Flight controls free and responding correctly. Fuel selector on proper setting. Trim tab set.

14. Do your engine check. This covers the operation of the magnetos, vacuum pumps, and alternator.

15. Oil pressure and temperature are in the green. Check and set the flight instruments, and just before you're ready to go, set the airplane lighting, flaps, and the transponder.

16. A left hand pattern is standard and should be used unless specified otherwise for an airport.

17. The upwind leg is the direction the airplane is flown on takeoff. The crosswind leg is flown at a ninety degree angle to the landing runway and off its takeoff end. On the

  

downwind leg you fly parallel to the landing runway but in the direction opposite to landing. The base leg is flown at a ninety degree angle to the landing runway and off its approach end. On the final approach leg you are aligned with the landing runway and therefore, heading into the wind.

18. Exit from the pattern is made after reaching pattern altitude either straight out or with a 45 degree turn.

19. The entry to the pattern is made on a forty-five degree angle to the midpoint of the downwind leg.

20. Runway numbers are determined from the approach direction. The runway number is the runway's magnetic direction rounded off to the nearest ten degrees and dropping the last zero.

21. For example, runway three six would be used for taking off and landing approximately to the north. The runway name on the other end of three six would be one eight.

22. Because runway numbers are magnetic, the runway heading should agree with the magnetic compass.

  

## Closer Look: Wind Direction Indicators

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 18_

Most of the time you will take off and land into the wind. To know the direction of the wind, airports have indicators that show its direction.

### Review:

1.    The three most common types of wind direction indicators are the wind sock, the wind tee, and the tetrahedron. They all operate like a weathervane.

2.    The wind sock is a large, funnel shaped device. The wind tee resembles a small airplane. The tetrahedron looks like a flattened pyramid.

3.    The most common of the three is the wind sock.

4.    Many airports also offer an automated weather recording system over a dedicated frequency, referred to as an AWOS or ASOS.

5.    The AWOS/ASOS frequency is located on the sectional and on the airport info page on mobile apps.

6.    If there is no significant wind reported, find out if there is a preferred runway at the airport for takeoff and landing. This will take into account for runway slope, nearby obstructions and noise abatement procedures, if applicable.

  

## Takeoff

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 19_

Takeoff is not difficult because the airplane is designed to fly – it wants to get off the ground.

### Review:

1.    For takeoff at an airport without a control tower, announce over the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that you're taxiing onto the active runway, check for other airplanes, and align the nose of your airplane on the centerline.

2.    Add power smoothly. The throttle should be fully forward within a few seconds.

3.    Pick a spot or an object beyond the end of the runway in line with the centerline. This will help you keep the airplane on a straight course after takeoff.

4.    Heels on the floor. Use the rudder pedals to maintain directional control.

5.    A climbing airplane wants to turn left; this is overcome by the use of right rudder.

6.    As speed increases, the rudder becomes more effective until by lift-off speed it will provide directional control. Ease back on the control wheel just enough to let the airplane fly itself off the runway.

7.    Now, allow the airplane to accelerate to climb speed. When reached, trim to maintain attitude.

8.    Maintain the runway centerline. A turn for departure or to enter the downwind pattern should not be made until you are approximately three hundred feet below pattern altitude. Depart on a 45 degree heading or straight out.

9.    As you climb out, occasionally check the gauges. Keep an eye out for traffic.

  

## Closer Look: Tower Controlled Field

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 20_

When ready to taxi to the takeoff runway at a tower controlled field, call ground control with your request. Remember the four Ws when making the call.

### Review:

1.    Once you begin taxiing, ensure you clearly understand your route and clearance limit. Focus solely on this task and defer any aircraft checks, GPS programming or other distractions until you’re positioned at the run-up area.

2.    Remember to stay tuned to ground control until reaching the takeoff runway in case there are any further instructions.

3.    One of the biggest differences in a towered airport and a nontowered one is the amount of traffic there.

4.    At the run-up area, perform your before takeoff checklist normally, and taxi to the hold short lines, or get in line for takeoff if there are other airplanes waiting. Contact the tower, advising them that you're ready to go – remember the four Ws.

5.    Your initial call to tower might go something like this, “Lunken tower, Cessna 3-8-8 echo sierra, at runway 7, ready for takeoff.”

6.    At this point, follow tower control’s directions.

  

## Air Facts: Takeoff Tips

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 21_

Takeoffs are really a lot of fun. It’s one of the purest moments of flight.

### Review:

1.    Taking off has its own set of challenges. Make sure that there are no other airplanes landing. Someone might be flying an incorrect pattern.

2.    Even at a towered airport, when the tower clears you to taxi into position and hold, it's a good idea to check the final approach course to make sure nobody is there.

3.    Another takeoff challenge is directional control. Relax. Make sure you're not applying pressure to the brakes or to both rudder pedals at once.

4.    Make sure you have the seat far enough forward so that you can use full rudder travel.

5.    The final challenge on takeoff is achieving the proper pitch attitude. It takes more back pressure on the control wheel to rotate the airplane to the initial climb attitude than it takes to keep the airplane in that attitude.

  

## Four Fundamentals

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 22_

Every maneuver you do with an airplane involves the four fundamentals of flight – turns, straight-and-level, climbs, and descents.

### Review:

1.    Controlling an airplane consists of either one, or a combination of, turns,

straight-and-level, climbs, and descents. You will also have to consider the proper power setting, and the pitch and bank attitude of the airplane.

2.    The primary reference for attitude is the relationship between a point on the airplane and the horizon.

3.    Inside the airplane, the position of the miniature airplane on the attitude indicator shows the attitude of the airplane.

4.    The altimeter, heading indicator, airspeed indicator, and the turn coordinator are used to verify, and cross check, the attitude presented by either the natural horizon or the attitude indicator.

5.    The three components involved in airplane control are pitch, bank, and power. The proper combination of pitch and power will always produce a predictable performance.

6.    In a turn, you will use all three primary controls – the ailerons, the rudder, and the elevator.

7.    There are three types of turn – shallow bank (a bank angle of less than twenty degrees), medium bank (a bank angle of between twenty and forty five degree), and steep turns (a bank angle greater than forty five degrees).

8.    To turn, move the control wheel left or right. In a turn, the airplane will want to yaw opposite the bank

9.    – rudder is needed to keep the turn coordinated. You will also need to apply back pressure on the elevator control to maintain the vertical lift needed to oppose gravity.

10. The reference for pitch attitude control should be a point on the engine cowl or windshield in line with the horizon and directly in front of you.

11. Always clear the area before you turn.

12. In a medium bank turn, once the bank angle is established, neutralize the controls but keep a little back pressure to maintain altitude.

13. Rolling out of the turn is like the roll-in, except control pressures are used opposite the turn, and elevator control back pressure is decreased as the bank decreases.

14. In a steep turn, the bank will tend to increase. You will need some aileron pressure against the turn to keep the bank from increasing. Also, the elevator pressure needed to maintain level flight will be greater than that required for a medium bank turn.

15. The roll-out from the turn must be started before reaching the desired heading.

  

16. As the airplane starts banking, the nose should start turning. If the nose turns before the bank starts, rudder pressure is being used too soon. If the nose doesn't turn, or turns in the opposite direction as the bank starts, the rudder pressure is being applied too late.

17. The inclinometer, or ball, will tell you if the turn is balanced or not. If the ball moves right, step on the ball, that is, use right rudder. If it moves left, apply some left rudder to center it.

  

## Air Facts: Pitching and Turning

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 23_

This section will give you a few useful ideas on pitch control and its importance.

### Review:

1.    As the bank angle increases past a shallow bank, you need more back elevator pressure and a little opposite aileron to keep the bank from increasing.

2.    An airplane is stable in straight-and-level, properly trimmed, flight. In a turn, you are still stable, but things are different. So much so, that loss of control may be possible.

3.    If the bank were to become steep enough, you may not have enough up elevator or opposite aileron to stop the bank. If everything is allowed to go to maximum, the airplane will be out of control.

4.    If either up elevator and/or opposite aileron are becoming excessive in your bank, the way to fix it is to lower the nose a bit and reduce the angle of bank.

5.    You might consider not using a bank angle of more than 30 degrees to ensure controllability.

6.    A good rule of thumb might be; fly so your passengers hardly notice the changes that you make.

  

## Four Fundamentals (part 2)

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 24_

Every maneuver you do with an airplane involves the four fundamentals of flight – turns, straight-and-level, climbs, and descents.

### Review:

1.    In straight-and-level flight, pick a point on the nose of the airplane directly in front of you, and keep that point in a fixed position in relation to the horizon.

2.    The position of the wing tips, in relation to the horizon, will help as well. Check the altimeter occasionally to see if your altitude is correct.

3.    Trim should be used to relieve the control pressures.

4.    The attitude indicator is used for pitch attitude information when the horizon isn't visible.

5.    Airspeed indications should stay fairly constant in level flight.

6.    In level flight and smooth air, the vertical speed indicator should show a zero rate of climb or descent.

7.    If you decrease the power in level flight, the airplane will descend. Conversely, increasing the power setting will make the airplane climb.

8.    To fly straight, choose some point on the ground and keep the nose of the airplane headed to that point. Check the heading indicator occasionally to be sure that the airplane is flying in a constant direction.

9.    Any slight bank will cause the airplane to turn. The reference instruments for straight flight are the attitude indicator, heading indicator, and the turn coordinator.

10.  The attitude indicator shows changes in bank instantly. The position of the bank scale pointer will give you a good check for wings level flight.

11.  Bank is indirectly shown on the heading indicator because even a small bank will make the airplane turn.

12.  The turn coordinator provides an indirect indication of bank.

13.  If the wings are level, and the inclinometer or ball is centered, the airplane is in straight flight.

14.  If the airplane is properly trimmed and the air is smooth, you won't need to hold control pressures to fly straight-and-level.

15.  A climb is the basic maneuver where the combination of pitch and power allow the airplane to gain altitude. To start the climb, simultaneously apply back pressure to the elevator and set the throttle for climb power. Use rudder to help maintain heading.

16.  For the best climb rate, climbing turns should be made with a shallow bank. To recover to straight- and-level, start the level off about fifty feet before the desired altitude. Maintain climb power until cruise speed is achieved.

17.  Descents are made with a wide range of airspeeds and rates of descent.

18.  The speed that will yield the greatest forward travel for the altitude lost is called the best glide speed.

  

19.  To enter the normal glide, reduce power and apply back pressure to the elevator to maintain altitude. When the airspeed approaches the desired airspeed, the pitch attitude is lowered to maintain this speed. After the airspeed has stabilized, the airplane should be trimmed for hands-off flight.

20.  You may have to use a little left rudder in a descent. Also, the controls are less effective in a reduced power situation. During prolonged operation at low or idle power settings, clear the engine by opening the throttle for a short period – helps keep the engine temperature constant.

21.  As with climbs, you must start to level off before reaching the desired altitude. Generally, starting the level off 50 to 100 feet before reaching the desired altitude. When you have reached the desired altitude, increase power to maintain it.

  

## Air Facts: The Proper Attitude

_Private Pilot Chapter 1 – Video Segment 25_

This section will further study the concept of airplane attitude – especially the notion that a wing could potentially stall at any airspeed and in any attitude.

### Review:

1.    Look at the pitch attitude of the airplane – nose up for example – and then look at the vertical speed indicator. If the airplane is climbing, the angle of attack is relatively low. But if the nose is up and the airplane is descending, then the angle of attack is high.

2.    The airplane can even stall with the nose down if you rapidly increase back pressure and the wing blocks its own flow of air over its surface.

3.    If the pitch attitude is in one direction, such as up, and the path of the airplane is in another direction, such as down, then the angle of attack is likely high.

4.    If you make smooth and gentle changes in attitude, you won’t have to worry about exceeding the critical angle of attack.

5.    The question to ask yourself is: where is the airplane pointed compared to where it’s moving? If you can answer that question, you can visualize the relative wind and the angle of attack.

6.    Regardless of how your airplane is equipped, there’s a key takeaway here: try to fly smoothly. If you avoid aggressive maneuvers and keep the airspeed comfortably above stall speed, chances are low that you’ll ever be caught off guard by an inadvertent stall.
