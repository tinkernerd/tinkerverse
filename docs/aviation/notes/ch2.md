# Chapter 2 – Practicing Landings

## Ground Reference Maneuvers

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 1_

The air mass in which you're flying may also be moving – many times not in the same direction that you want to go. The net effect is that the direction your airplane's nose is pointed may not necessarily be where you’ll end up, and your airspeed is not always the same as your groundspeed. So, how do we compensate for the effect of the wind?

### Review:

1.    A wind blowing from the side will make the airplane drift away from your course. To stay on course, point the airplane into the wind to offset the wind from the side. This is called a crab angle.

2.    The direction the airplane is pointing is the heading, and the actual path made over the surface is the track. You want the course and track to be identical.

3.    To practice correcting for wind drift in both straight and turning flight, you will practice ground reference maneuvers – rectangular course, s turns, and turns around a point.

4.    Ground reference maneuvers will help to develop your ability to recognize and correct for the effect of wind. You learn to control the airplane by looking outside, checking your gauges inside, and keeping an eye out for traffic.

5.    From the air you can see many wind indicators – smoke, blowing dust, trees, waves on water, and fields of grain crops.

6.    Ground reference maneuvers are flown between 600 and 1,000 feet above the ground, the usual traffic pattern altitude – distances and mistakes are easier to judge at a lower altitude.

7.    Wherever you choose to practice ground reference maneuvers, you must comply with the minimum altitude rules of the federal aviation regulations – see FAR 91.119.

8.    In the case of an emergency, scope out the availability of an appropriate landing area before you start your practice.

9.    The rectangular course resembles the airport traffic pattern. Select a rectangle or square field with sides between 1/2 and one mile long with boundaries defined by roads or section lines. The airplane is flown outside the rectangle, parallel to the boundaries.

10.  The distance from the boundaries should be the same distance as the downwind leg of the traffic pattern is from the runway. Practice left and right turns and don’t exceed medium bank turns.

11.  For our purpose here we will consider the wind to be on our nose on our initial 45 degree entry. We are entering upwind.

12.  The turn to the crosswind leg is started when the airplane is even with the corner. It starts into a direct headwind and ends with a crosswind. The turn is less than 90 degrees

  

because the airplane will have to be crabbed to the left to compensate for the crosswind from the left.

13.  Start the downwind turn when the airplane is abeam the downwind boundary. This turn is greater than 90 degrees because of the crab.

14.  Turning to base leg, the wind will be from the right, calling for a crab to the right a turn greater than 90 degrees.

15.  Finally, turning to the upwind leg, the turn is less than 90 degrees.

16.  It's important that you plan ahead of the airplane – knowing what to do before you get there will help guarantee success.

  

## Closer Look: Taxi Tips

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 2_

In this section we’ll take a closer look at how to make your taxi time more useful to your flying.

### Review:

1.    Always pay attention to what’s going on around you as you taxi.

2.    Be conscious of your surroundings while the propeller is turning. It’s courteous to avoid long periods on a crowded ramp or near a building with the engine running. After completing the after start check, use gentle applications of power to carefully maneuver the airplane to a location away from people and buildings.

3.    Check your instruments to ensure they are moving in the correct direction – especially the turn coordinator and the heading indicator.

4.    Use your feet to steer but keep one hand on the control wheel and the other hand on the throttle.

5.    You’ll want to avoid taxiing with power while simultaneously applying the brakes - the aviation equivalent of using the gas and brake pedals at the same time. Once you get some momentum, the airplane will require only a slight amount of power to continue moving forward.

6.    When it comes time to cross runways or other taxiways, make sure to look both ways to visually verify there are no aircraft coming your way. You should do the same at

tower-controlled airports as a double-check to your ATC clearance.

7.    Finally, think ahead to the takeoff and flight anticipating what could go wrong and what your first reactions may be. Discuss your objectives with your instructor and begin mentally rehearsing them.

  

## Engines

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 3_

The use of internal combustion engines in aircraft presents a unique problem because fuel will only burn well when it is mixed with air in the proper proportion.

### Review:

1.    The ratio of air to fuel is correct at sea level when the mixture control is set to full rich.

2.    As an airplane climbs the air becomes less dense but the fuel flow remains the same. The airplane is receiving less air and the mixture becomes richer, hence the need to lean out the mixture.

3.    A too rich mixture will cause the engine to run rough and lose power. A properly leaned engine will run more smoothly and efficiently, and not be subjected to spark plug fouling.

4.    For the analog gauge equipped Skyhawk, the exhaust gas temperature gauge is used for leaning at cruise. You will find the peak EGT and use it as a reference. Once peak EGT is reached, enrich the mixture to reduce the EGT 50 degrees.

5.    Any time the throttle position or altitude changes, the mixture will have to be reset.

6.    The G1000 displays the temperature for each cylinder. Pressing the engine and lean keys brings up a bar graph showing the EGT of all the cylinders, with the hottest cylinder colored cyan. If you press the assist key, then, as you slowly lean the mixture, the peak EGT is automatically detected and displayed as a hollow bar on the graph.

7.    If your airplane doesn’t have an EGT, lean with the mixture control until the engine begins to run rough, then enrich until the engine runs smooth again.

8.    Normally you will use a full rich mixture for take-off and climb. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines here.

9.    Spark plugs are used in engines to provide an electric arc that will ignite the mixture. To work properly, its gap must be set accurately. A plug covered with deposits can degrade an engine’s performance.

10.  An excessive mag drop may occur if a plug is fouled.

11.  Normal combustion produces a smooth, downward pressure on the piston. However, there are two problems that can occur to cause abnormal combustion – detonation, and preignition.

12.  Detonation occurs when the fuel and air mixture is subjected to a very high temperature in the cylinder and the spontaneous combustion point of the mixture is reached. This causes a sudden explosion which produces extremely high pressure.

13.  It’s hard to hear detonation in an aircraft engine due to all the other aircraft noises, but it shows up as a loss of engine power and overheating.

14.  Detonation may be caused by using too low a grade of fuel, climbing at too slow an airspeed, or using too lean a mixture with a high power setting.

  

15.  Preignition is the uncontrolled igniting of the fuel and air mixture before the time the spark plugs are set to fire. When preignition occurs, the piston is still rising to the top of the cylinder.

16.  Preignition exerts a downward force opposite the travel of the piston creating severe structural stresses on the engine.

17.  One of the most reliable indicators of preignition is loss of power.

  

## Air Facts: Engine Suspicion

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 4_

More advanced engines, such as the turbo charged varieties, require a lot more care than those used in most training airplanes.

### Review:

1.    If we lay a good foundation by taking care of the four-cylinder engines during the early days of training, we’ll be ready for more advanced flying down the road.

2.    In turbocharged engines, it's best to run with the mixture a bit on the rich side. This will generally keep the engine cooler, so that the heat that causes detonation or preignition is not as likely to develop.

3.    Airplanes with more advanced engines usually have better instrumentation to help the pilot monitor and set a proper mixture.

4.    Always be aware of any engine abnormality that happens right before takeoff. Don't continue - get it checked out. If something seems out of the ordinary when you are in the air, land as soon as it's safe and have a mechanic look at it.

  

## Aerodynamics

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 5_

In this section, we will continue our investigation of airplane aerodynamics. Review, if necessary, the discussion in Volume 1 regarding lift, weight, thrust, and drag.

### Review:

1.    There are two types of drag on an airplane – induced drag and parasite drag.

2.    Induced drag is the rearward retarding force caused by the wings creating lift. Parasite drag is caused by the fuselage and other protrusions disrupting the flow of air. Drag opposes thrust.

3.    If the airplane is in a steady climb or descent, you can further break down the forces of lift, weight, thrust, and drag into their horizontal and vertical components.

4.    If the airspeed is decreasing, the rearward forces are greater than the forward forces.

5.    The angle of attack is the angle between the chord of the wing and the relative wind. Simply stated, angle of attack is the angle between where the wing is pointed and where it's actually going. Don't confuse the angle of attack with the pitch attitude of the airplane.

6.    By changing the angle of attack, you control and change airspeed, lift, and drag.

7.    At a low angle of attack, most of the lift is caused by the decrease in pressure above the wing. As the angle of attack increases, the lift caused by the higher pressure below the wing increases. Eventually the angle of attack becomes so large that the airflow can't flow over the top of the wing.

8.    When this happens the airfoil has reached the stalling angle of attack, sometimes called the critical angle of attack or the burble point.

9.    The rotary motion of the air which flows from the wingtip is called a wingtip vortex. Wingtip vortices are a by-product of lift and increase in intensity as lift increases.

10.  Vortices are greatest when you have a relatively high angle of attack, for example on takeoff and landing. They diminish somewhat at cruise speed.

11.  A wing’s center of lift can be thought of as the point where all the lift acts. In actual practice, to determine the center of the wings lifting force, you must also consider the pressures below the wing.

12.  As you increase the angle of attack, airflow separation moves toward the front of the wing. For example, at minimal controllable airspeed, any increase in angle of attack or load factor, or any reduction in power, will result in an immediate stall.

13.  The turbulent airflow spreads forward and outward from the wing root.

14.  As the wing is stalled, lift diminishes rapidly. Air flow is turbulent farther outboard on the wing, but the wing tips are still providing lift. The ailerons continue to have some effectiveness so some roll control remains.

15.  That the wing stalls progressively from the wing root outward toward the wing tip, is advantageous.

  

16.  The stall progresses this way because of modern wing design. For example, the wing is attached to the fuselage at an angle, called the angle of incidence. Also, the wing is slightly twisted, called washout. These design characteristics allows the outboard portion of the wing to have a lower angle of attack while the inboard part of the wing is at the stalling angle of attack.

17.  An airplane tends to turn left when using high power at low speeds. Viewed from the pilot's seat, the crankshaft and propeller on American made engines turn clockwise.

18.  Engine torque, the tendency of the airplane to turn opposite the propeller rotation, spiraling slipstream, gyroscopic precession, and asymmetrical propeller loading all contribute to make the airplane turn left.

19.  The spiraling slipstream or corkscrew effect is caused by high propeller speed and is most pronounced at low forward speeds. The propeller rotation causes the slipstream to rotate clockwise around the fuselage striking the vertical stabilizer on the left side making the nose yaw to the left.

20.  The propeller acts like a gyroscope in that a force applied to the propeller becomes apparent ninety degrees from the point where it was applied.

21.  P-factor, asymmetric propeller loading, occurs when you fly the airplane at a high angle of attack. The descending blade has a higher angle of attack and therefore much higher thrust than the ascending blade on the left, causing the airplane to yaw to the left.

22.  Modern airplanes are designed to correct for the left turning tendency at cruise speed and power. At high speed and low power, such as in a descent, you may have to correct with left rudder to prevent yawing to the right.

  

## Closer Look: Angle of Attack

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 6_

You’ve probably heard that “a wing can be stalled at any airspeed and at any attitude.” While that’s absolutely true, it’s not very intuitive. In this section, we will take a closer look at the meaning of angle of attack.

### Review:

1.    The critical angle of attack remains the same - regardless of airspeed, weight, pitch attitude, and bank angle.

2.    Exceeding the critical angle of attack will cause the wing to stall - every time.

3.    In general, keep the airspeed in the green arc and you won’t stall. Put another way, if your airspeed is high, your angle of attack is probably low.

4.    In steeply banked turns or other unusual attitudes, airspeed is not nearly as accurate a substitute for angle of attack.

5.    Maintain an awareness of your angle of attack at all times, and ask yourself if the airplane’s pitch attitude and flight path are significantly different.

6.    Try to fly smoothly. If you avoid aggressive maneuvers and keep the airspeed comfortably above stall speed, you will most likely fly your entire career without ever getting close to a stall.

  

## Slow Flight

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 7_

Slow flight and stalls are taught to make you familiar with the feel, sight, sounds, and other perceptions of the reduced margin between flying and stalling, and to develop a conditioned reflex to take prompt corrective action.

### Review:

1.    Slow flight will develop your feel for the controls and reinforce the relationships of airspeed and attitude control.

2.    It also helps to familiarize you with the control pressures and techniques needed to fly the airplane right after takeoff and just before the landing touchdown.

3.    To maintain altitude at low airspeeds the angle of attack must be increased. The angle of attack needed to maintain altitude at speeds near stalling causes a sharp rise in induced drag.

4.    The airspeed which corresponds to the lowest total drag is the airspeed for maximum endurance. This is the lowest thrust required for level flight and will result in the lowest fuel consumption and allow flight for the longest time.

5.    From this point, to the stall airspeed, is what is called the backside of the power curve or the region of reversed command.

6.    In this configuration, to go slower and maintain altitude, you will have to increase power. Any decrease in power will result in a loss of altitude.

7.    To slow fly the airplane, clear the area, and start reducing power. At the same time, increase back pressure to maintain your altitude and trim off any pressure.

8.    When the airspeed is within 5 knots of the desired slow flight airspeed, increase the power just enough to maintain altitude.

9.    You will have to apply right rudder to maintain coordinated flight because of the effect of high power, engine torque, P-factor, and the spiraling slipstream.

10.  Check the ball frequently as well as the attitude indicator and altimeter.

11.  Scan for traffic.

12.  Now practice shallow turns during slow flight. Level turns at slow flight airspeed require adding power to maintain altitude, and pitch must also be changed slightly to maintain airspeed.

13.  Maneuvering during slow flight should be practiced in all flap configurations.

14.  Remember, extending the flaps lowers the stalling speed. However, because of the added drag, power must be increased if you want to maintain altitude.

15.  With the slow speed, high drag, and high lift condition of full flaps, there is little power left to climb.

16.  This is the situation when a landing has to be abandoned and a go around started in the last moments of a landing. The airspeed may be below the no flap stalling speed and sudden retraction of the flaps may stall the airplane.

  

17.  To recover, full power is used and flaps are slowly retracted one position at a time. As flaps are retracted back elevator pressure must be used to make up for the loss of lift.

  

## Closer Look: Change of Scenery

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 8_

In this section we are looking at ways to break up the monotony of flight lessons while having fun.

### Review:

1.    One of the best ways to break up the maneuvers phase of your flight training is to leave your local airport environment and fly to new airport.

2.    There will be days during your training when it seems tough to get excited about another lesson consisting of basic flight maneuvers. Don’t worry, this is completely normal and your instructor obviously has good intentions.

3.    Try scheduling your flight lesson at a different time of day or if you normally fly during the week in between school or work, try a few weekend lessons when you have less on your mind.

4.    When practicing landings, a change of scenery can make all the difference in the world. While you can save time by staying at your home airport for repeated takeoff and landing practice, you may find it beneficial when having trouble with the traffic pattern and landings to head to a new airport for a new perspective.

5.    If your flight school is based at a non-towered airport, ask your instructor to take you to a towered-airport for multiple landings; conversely, if you regularly operate out of a towered-airport, fly over to a non-towered field for some practice.

6.    Refining the skills required by these maneuvers will ultimately make you a more capable and well-rounded pilot. But of course one of the main reasons you’re learning to fly in the first place is for the fun of it.

7.    If you normally fly during the week in between school or work, try a few weekend lessons when you have less on your mind.

8.    Your instructor should notice when your interest begins to wander, but don’t feel like you have to wait for them to mix things up. You should always be open with them and speak up if you want a change of scenery during your lessons, even if only for a lesson or two. You’ll be instantly reminded of how much fun flying truly is and learn valuable skills along the way.

  

## Stalls

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 9_

Stalls are practiced to enable you to recognize an impending stall and to react in the proper manner.

### Review:

1.    Practicing stalls will also help you learn the low airspeed flight characteristics of the airplane, and how to control it at low airspeeds.

2.    Part of your practice will include recognizing the first indications of a stall – these are called imminent stalls.

3.    When practicing imminent stalls, the recovery is made at the first indication of a stall. The airplane is not allowed to become fully stalled. The object of this maneuver is to avoid a full stall.

4.    When doing full stalls, the stall is allowed to progress until full up elevator, buffeting, and nose down pitching are reached.

5.    During recovery from a fully stalled condition, you need to recover with a minimum loss of altitude and without entering a secondary stall.

6.    A secondary stall occurs when the pitch attitude is raised too soon or too high during the first stall recovery. Recover in the normal way.

7.    Stalls are especially dangerous when they occur close to the ground or if the pilot tries to recover in the wrong way.

8.    A wing will always stall at the same angle of attack – this occurs when the angle of attack reaches approximately 16 to 18 degrees. However, weight, bank angle, power setting, and load factor may change the speed or the pitch attitude at which the airplane stalls.

9.    To recover from a stall, you must reduce the angle of attack, either by adding power or sacrificing altitude.

10.  Stall recoveries can be made without power, and your instructor will probably have you do some power-off stall recoveries.

11.  Power-off stalls simulate approach and landing conditions. Power-on stalls simulate takeoff and departure situations.

12.  Power-off stalls are normally called approach to landing stalls. They are practiced either as imminent or full stalls.

13.  When practicing stalls, make sure the airplane is of the proper weight, that it is balanced, and the maneuver is flown at a safe altitude above the ground.

14.  If weight is loaded too far forward, the airplane will stall at a higher airspeed; and if loaded too far aft, stall recovery may be difficult.

  

15.  For the power-off stall, set up the airplane in the approach mode, then start to bring the nose up slowly until the airplane stalls. Don’t exceed a normal climb attitude. Recover in the normal way – lower the nose and simultaneously apply full power.

16.  Imminent power-off stalls during turns should be made at 20 degrees of bank – simulating the turn from base to final.

17.  During the stall entry, use control pressures as necessary to prevent the bank angle from changing, keep the ball in the center, and keep the nose from dropping. Then, at the first sign of the stall, lower the nose, apply power, and level the wings.

18.  The entry procedure for doing full stalls straight ahead with power off is the same as for the imminent stalls. Usually the best clue that the airplane has stalled occurs when the elevator control is full back and the nose pitches down.

19.  Recovery from the full stall will require a lower pitch attitude in order to avoid a secondary stall and the altitude loss will be greater. Reduce the angle of attack, add full power, and maintain directional control using coordinated rudder and aileron pressures.

20.  Power-on stalls simulate takeoff and are entered in the takeoff configuration at takeoff speed and power. They are done straight ahead and in turns up to a maximum bank angle of 20 degrees.

21.  In the imminent takeoff stall, the speed is reduced to liftoff speed, takeoff or recommended power is applied, and the pitch attitude is raised to the normal climb attitude – don’t forget to apply a lot of right rudder to keep the ball centered.

22.  Raise the nose above the climb attitude and hold it in this position until the first buffet or control effectiveness decay is felt. At the first sign of a stall, recover by lowering the pitch attitude to slightly below level flight.

23.  The full takeoff stall is identical to the imminent stall with the exception that the recovery is delayed until the airplane is fully stalled.

24.  Note: during power-on turning stalls to the right, you may find it necessary to use right rudder to overcome torque and "P" factor, and left aileron to prevent the bank from increasing.

25.  If the turn is perfectly coordinated at the stall, the airplane should not experience any rolling moment. The nose simply pitches away from the pilot.

26.  The main elements that determine the angle of attack of a wing are airspeed, weight, and load factor.

27.  Without an increased load factor, the normal weight of the airplane is 1-G. The previously discussed stalls were done at 1 G or only slightly more in turning stalls.

28.  An increase in weight or an increase in load factor will cause the airplane to stall at a higher speed.

29.  Stalls caused by an increased load factor are called accelerated stalls. They occur during a steep turn or an abrupt pitch change.

30.  With power reduced, the airplane should be slowed to a speed one and one half times the normal stall speed in straight flight. Then initiate a 45 degree banked turn with back elevator pressure used to maintain altitude. When the bank is established, back elevator pressure is briskly increased to bring about the stall.

  

## Air Facts: Stall Rhetoric

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 10_

Many students don’t like the idea of doing stall practice. It may be that the term stall has a negative connotation.

### Review:

1.    Stalls are, for the most part, easy to do and recover from – simply ease the back pressure on the control wheel. The loads in a stall are quite low too because the airspeed is low.

2.    If the ball is not centered during the stall, the airplane may tend to roll. The first time you experience this you may be a little startled.

3.    You recover from the stall by lowering the nose and leveling the wings with coordinated use of aileron and rudder.

4.    Remember, if the ball is in the middle, the airplane will likely stall with little, or no roll, in either direction.

5.    Stalling an airplane in uncoordinated flight, ball off center, and control wheel full back, may cause the airplane to start into a spin.

6.    To recover set power to idle, neutralize the ailerons, apply full rudder pressure opposite the spin – right rudder if the spin is to the left. At the same time, relax the full aft elevator pressure. Recover from the developing dive with a smooth application of aft elevator control.

7.    When low and slow, be wary and develop an instinctive reaction to move the elevator control forward to reduce angle of attack at any time the airplane feels near a stall.

  

## Normal Landings

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 11_

This section discusses your approach to the airport, proper pattern techniques, landing, taxi, and engine shutdown.

### Review:

1.    Approximately ten miles from a nontowered airport, call on the common traffic advisory frequency and announce your intention to land and request an airport advisory.

2.    In the pattern you will make additional calls on each leg of the pattern.

3.    If there is a tower present, do the same as you would for a nontowered airport. However, in this case, the tower will advise you of the active runway and give you other pertinent information.

4.    As you head toward the airport, descend to the traffic pattern altitude before you arrive. Always avoid descending entries into the traffic pattern because of collision hazards.

5.    Even though some airports are nontowered, there are still important procedures necessary to ensure safety and uniformity of activity.

6.    Enter the downwind leg at a 45 degree angle. If approaching from the opposite side of the airport, enter the pattern 45 degrees to the upwind leg. At a towered airport, the controller will advise you how to approach and enter the pattern.

7.    As you enter the pattern, conduct your pre-landing checklist. Fly parallel to the landing runway. Fly all legs of the pattern at a close enough distance that in the event of a loss of power, you can make the runway safely.

8.    On downwind, reduce power and maintain altitude to slow the aircraft to the flap operating speed range shown by the white arc on the airspeed indicator.

9.    Set flaps on downwind, base, and final as per your instructor’s method for your particular airplane.

10.  Opposite the point of intended landing, reduce power to the appropriate RPM to further slow the airplane and start a descent.

11.  When the intended touchdown point is approximately 45 degrees behind the wing initiate a turn to the base leg. You may have to crab a bit here to compensate for wind.

12.  At about 45 degrees to the final approach, start to judge whether you need to start a turn to final or hold your course a bit longer – wind and altitude are the primary factors here in your decision.

13.  Use a medium bank turn from base to final and you should end up on final aligned with the runway.

14.  Aligned with the runway, set flaps as necessary and trim for the final approach speed.

15.  At this position you should be on the proper glidepath to touchdown – consider the glidepath like a line extending from your airplane to your point of intended landing.

16.  The airplane should never be allowed to go below the glidepath or the approach speed.

  

17.  Normally, it will take the airplane a longer time to reach the runway because you are flying into a headwind.

18.  You will have to control pitch and power all the way to touchdown. Remember, you want your airspeed to remain relatively constant throughout.

19.  Judging your height takes practice. The runway’s perspective looks different depending on your altitude on final.

20.  Select an aiming point down the runway. Align the aiming point with a place on the windshield. If the aiming point stays on the same place on the windshield, then you're on the right glidepath. If the aiming point moves down on the windshield, you're above the right glidepath, if it moves up you are too low.

21.  Keep the airplane aligned with the runway. As you get closer, focus your sight far enough ahead of the airplane to see objects clearly.

22.  As you get close to the ground, start a reduction in power and begin to flare. This reduces your descent rate. As your airplane approaches the runway, increase the flare to touchdown. Ideally, the control wheel should be all the way back at touchdown – the perfect stall.

23.  Let the nose wheel gradually settle to the runway. Maintain directional control with the rudder pedals until the aircraft loses speed and you can taxi clear of the active. Announce your intentions. At a tower controlled airport follow the controller’s directions.

24.  Do the after landing and shutdown checklists. Pull the mixture to idle cutoff and when the prop stops turning, turn the magnetos and master switch off. Install the control lock, if available.

  

## Air Facts: Down to Earth

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 12_

You learn to land by doing a lot of landings – they take practice.

### Review:

1.    One of the keys to learning to land is to remain undaunted by mistakes. Everybody makes them, and everybody learns from them.

2.    You will go through phases in your practice. Sometimes the landings seem to be coming right along. At other times they seem to be a disaster. Don’t become discouraged. It will work out.

3.    You want to make all your mistakes before you solo. Consider each mistake a learning experience.

4.    Your landings should become smoother and smoother, regardless of the wind – this takes a while.

5.    Oftentimes, the pilot causes the existing turbulence to be worse than it is because of his abrupt control inputs. Try to relax on the controls and see what happens. Usually, the bumpiness will diminish.

6.    Of course, you can’t sit there and do nothing. However, with practice, you will learn to use the necessary control inputs to keep the airplane in the proper landing attitude.

  

## Takeoff & Landing Variations

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 13_

In this section we will discuss the various types of takeoffs and landings you will learn, as well as the techniques to do them successfully.

### Review:

1.    We always try to land into the wind. A headwind generates airspeed and shortens the ground roll.

2.    To takeoff in a crosswind, line up on the runway as usual, place the upwind aileron in the full up position, and use rudder to keep the airplane rolling straight down the runway.

3.    As speed increases and the ailerons become effective, reduce some of the aileron held into the wind.

4.    The airplane’s area behind the main landing gear presents a wide surface to the wind and will cause the airplane to turn into the wind – just like a weathervane.

5.    Keep the airplane on the runway until reaching a higher than normal takeoff speed, then smoothly but firmly apply elevator back pressure.

6.    Don’t force the airplane into the air prematurely.

7.    Immediately after takeoff, keep the airplane in a sideslip. In other words, keep the upwind wing down using rudder to keep the airplane lined up with the runway. This will counteract the drifting effect of the crosswind.

8.    When the airplane is well above the runway, the wings should be leveled and a crab established to keep the airplane on the extended centerline of the runway.

9.    To make a crosswind landing, use the appropriate flap settings for your airplane on downwind, base, and final.

10.  On final approach, the crosswind will drift the airplane toward the downwind side. There are two ways to correct for this drift – a sideslip or a crab.

11.  While the sideslip presents a little more challenge, there is less chance of landing with a side load on the gear.

12.  On final approach, the upwind wing is lowered and opposite rudder is used to keep the longitudinal axis of the airplane aligned with the runway.

13.  The sideslip is correct when the airplane stays on the extended center line of the runway and pointed straight down the runway. You adjust bank and rudder to keep it there.

14.  If you don't have enough rudder to keep the airplane lined up with the runway, the crosswind is too strong – go elsewhere to land.

15.  The slip is used throughout the landing and touchdown will be made on the upwind main gear.

16.  When you have learned to control drift with the sideslip, a combination of the crab and sideslip may be used.

17.  Crab the airplane on final approach to stay on the extended centerline of the runway, then, change the crab to a sideslip before touchdown.

  

18.  It’s important to learn how to land without the use of flaps – for example, if you encounter a strong wind situation or a flap lowering problem.

19.  Fly the pattern as before. On final, without flaps, the stalling speed will be higher and the descent angle will be flatter, so you need a faster approach speed. You can also expect a longer landing roll.

20.  If you are too high, rather than use flaps, use a forward slip. In a forward slip the airplane is pointed at an angle to its flight path. This is unlike in the sideslip in which the airplane is pointed down the runway.

21.  The forward slip turns the airplane's fuselage into the relative wind, creating a high drag, which produces a high rate of descent.

22.  Lower a wing to one side or the other, yaw the nose of the airplane in the opposite direction through the use of opposite rudder. Raise the nose a little to control airspeed. Close to the ground, level the wings and head the airplane down the runway.

23.  If there is a crosswind you will have to transition into a sideslip before your wheels touchdown.

24.  If you are low on final approach, apply power and raise the nose to increase lift and stop the descent. When back on the proper approach path, set up the necessary attitude and adjust power to hold it.

25.  If you get too slow on the approach, add power to increase lift and reduce the sink rate.

26.  If the landing is in doubt, go around for another approach.

27.  To go around, add full power, change the airplane's pitch attitude to slow or stop the rate of descent, and retract the flaps per manufacturer’s guidelines.

28.  If you retract the flaps suddenly at low airspeed, you might lose so much lift that you would settle onto the ground.

29.  Usually, it's best to raise the flaps slowly in small increments to allow time for the airplane to accelerate as the flaps are being retracted.

30.  If you round-out too high, stop the round-out by slightly releasing elevator back pressure and hold the pitch attitude constant. Then, let the airplane slow to the point where it begins to descend. You might also have to add some power to keep from losing lift and airspeed too rapidly. Now, set up the proper attitude and land.

31.  If you make a late or rapid round-out, you run the risk of an accelerated stall and a hard landing. In this situation, promptly add power and land normally if enough runway is left. If not, go around.

32.  If you are too high and fast, don’t dive and try to land the airplane on a specific spot. Excessive speed will cause you to float.

33.  If you approach with a too high of a sink rate, when the airplane touches down, it will bounce back into the air. If the bounce is slight, and no big pitch change is needed, correct by adding enough power to cushion the next touchdown and, at the same time, adjust the pitch to the proper landing attitude. If severe, go around.

  

## Nontowered Airport Communications

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 14_

This segment covers procedures for operating into and out of a non-tower airport. This type of airport will be found in Class G or Class E airspace.

### Review:

1.    Don't forget, radio communications are not mandatory at this type of airport. Proper reporting makes your operations safer, but there may be pilots flying without a radio.

2.    Maintain an active visual scan for other aircraft and always fly a standard traffic pattern even if you don't hear anything on the radio.

3.    When approaching a non-tower field, you should determine the active runway.

4.    Check out the local weather. Many non-tower airports in the U.S. have automated weather information available to the pilot. You can locate the frequency in the Chart Supplement, on your sectional, or in your GPS. The wind report may give you an idea of which runway is in use.

5.    The weather reporting system will typically update the message on a minute by minute basis. If the weather is changing, the broadcast will be updated quickly.

6.    The system may also have a provision for the airport operator to record NOTAMs that directly affect the airport. This can also be used for weather information that may not be easily discernible by the automated system.

7.    The CTAF frequency can be found the same way as the weather frequency. Listen to it for a few minutes to determine what other pilots are doing in the area.

8.    CTAF is an acronym for Common Traffic Advisory Frequency. It allows pilots to communicate their intentions in the environment of a non-towered airport.

9.    At many airports, CTAF and UNICOM are the same frequency. The CTAF frequency on the sectional is indicated by a circle with a "C" in the center.

10.  To give an advisory of your intention and position, call on CTAF by starting your communication with "Georgetown traffic." If you want information regarding the airport and its environment, call on the UNICOM frequency with the phrase, "Georgetown UNICOM."

11.  The CTAF frequency is not for casual chatter between the pilots of different aircraft or personnel on the ground. Non-essential communication on this frequency may block an important radio call that is critical to someone's safety.

12.  You should not transmit the phrase "Traffic in the area, please advise" to determine the active runway. This will only tend to clog the frequency without serving the intended purpose. Listening is much more effective.

13.  If the airport doesn't have a weather reporting station and no communications are heard on CTAF, call UNICOM for a landing advisory.

14.  If you know the active runway without the call to UNICOM, make your initial call on the CTAF frequency about ten miles out.

  

15.  Adding the name of the airport at the end of the transmission is optional but can be useful for advising others in the area where you are located. CTAF frequencies are used for multiple airports and this can be confusing.

16.  Shortened call signs are acceptable provided that your aircraft won't be confused with another on the frequency.

17.  Departure from a non-towered field begins on the ramp. Listen to the automated weather broadcast if available to determine the winds and potential active. Listen to the local CTAF frequency to ascertain what other aircraft in the vicinity of the airport are doing.

18.  The transponder is a useful communication device. It provides your aircraft with a higher degree of safety in an increasingly complex environment.

19.  Monitor the CTAF frequency during your taxi to the active runway but recognize that not all airport users may be using a radio. Keep your eyes open.

20.  Scan the area for traffic before announcing your departure. If all is clear, complete your lineup checks, including turning your transponder to altitude, announce your departure, scan the area again, and taxi onto the runway.

21.  "Position and hold" or "lineup and wait" should not be used at a non-towered airport.

22.  "Closed traffic" would indicate that you plan to remain in the traffic pattern at the Clermont County airport. After takeoff, you would call your turn to crosswind and successive legs as before.

23.  There are only two standard traffic pattern departures for non-towered airports: Straight-out and a forty-five degree turn in the direction of the pattern.

24.  Using a standard departure helps to improve safety at this type of air field.

25.  Your ultimate direction of flight should be included in your departure call.

26.  Correct communication is safety insurance. Adhering to the proper communication protocol, tells everyone you are a knowledgeable and professional pilot - a good example to all around you.

  

## Wake Turbulence Avoidance

_Private Pilot Chapter 2 – Video Segment 15_

1.    Another hazardous situation to avoid on takeoff and landing is wake turbulence. This invisible turbulence is caused by a pair of counter rotating vortices behind an airplane's wingtips, generated whenever a wing is developing lift.

2.    Their strength is determined by the wing’s shape, speed, and weight of the airplane. They are strongest behind large, slow airplanes that are taking off or landing.

3.    Avoid flying behind and below a large airplane. When taking off behind a large airplane, watch where it rotates and takeoff before that point. Climb above the large plane's climb path until you can turn away.

4.    Know that vortices drift so be careful around any large aircraft.

5.    Landing on the same runway, stay above the large airplane’s flight path, watch where it touches down, and land beyond that point.

6.    If you are landing behind a large departing airplane on the same runway, note where it rotates and land before that point.

7.    Allow at least three minutes to elapse before taking off or landing behind a large airplane to allow the turbulence to subside.

8.    If you are en route, under visual flight rules, avoid flight below and behind a large airplane's flight path.
