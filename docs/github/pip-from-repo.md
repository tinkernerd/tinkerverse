# **Pip Install from a GitHub Repo**

`Pip` is the package manager for Python that allows you to install libraries from repositories such as [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). However, there are scenarios where you may need to install Python libraries directly from a Git repository like GitHub or Bitbucket. This guide explains how to achieve this using different protocols (`HTTP`, `SSH`, and `Local`).

---

## **üí° Why Install from a Git Repo?**

There are several reasons why you might want to install Python packages directly from a Git repository:

1. **Unreleased Versions**: The library may have new features or bug fixes that haven‚Äôt been published to PyPI yet.
2. **Private Repositories**: The library might be hosted in a private repository that isn‚Äôt available on PyPI.
3. **Development Branches**: You may need a specific branch or commit of a project for compatibility or testing purposes.

---

## **üîó Installation Methods**

`Pip` supports installing packages directly from Git repositories using `git+<protocol>`. Below are the most common methods:

### **1. HTTP Protocol**
This is the most straightforward approach, using `HTTPS` to download the repository.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git
```

**Example:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git
```

---

### **2. SSH Protocol**
Using `SSH` is more secure and avoids the need to enter credentials repeatedly. This requires that you have set up SSH keys for the repository.

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git
```

**Example:**
```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/pallets/flask.git
```

**Advantages of SSH:**
- Credentials are handled by your SSH key, which simplifies repeated installations.
- Often preferred for private repositories.

---

### **3. Local Git Repository**
If you have the repository cloned locally, you can install the package directly from the local directory using the `file://` protocol.

```bash
pip install git+file:///path/to/your/local/repository
```

**Example:**
```bash
pip install git+file:///Users/username/projects/my-local-library
```

---

### **4. Installing Specific Branches or Tags**
If you need a specific branch, tag, or commit, you can specify it with a `@` at the end of the repository URL.

**Branch Example:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git@<branch>
# Example: pip install git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git@main
```

**Tag Example:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git@<tag>
# Example: pip install git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git@2.3.3
```

**Commit Example:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git@<commit-hash>
# Example: pip install git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git@4b2e5a2
```

---

### **5. Editable Installs**
If you‚Äôre working on a library and want to install it in "editable mode" to reflect changes in real-time:

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git#egg=<package_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git#egg=flask
```

---

## **üîê Working with Private Repositories**

If you‚Äôre installing a package from a private GitHub repository:
- Ensure you have the correct permissions.
- Use SSH or a Personal Access Token (PAT) for HTTP-based authentication.

**Example Using PAT:**
```bash
pip install git+https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git
```

**Example:**
```bash
pip install git+https://username:ghp_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv@github.com/myorg/my-private-repo.git
```

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è Additional Tips**

1. **Check Your `pip` Version**:  
   Some advanced features may require the latest version of `pip`. Upgrade it using:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Some repositories may have dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file. Use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   After installation, verify the package is available:
   ```bash
   python -m pip show <package_name>
   ```
