# **Introduction to Git**

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows for collaboration in software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become an essential tool for developers worldwide.

## **ðŸŒŸ Key Features of Git**
1. **Distributed Version Control**: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, ensuring redundancy.
2. **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed, even with large projects.
3. **Branching and Merging**: Work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously.
4. **Staging Area**: Allows for granular control over what changes to include in a commit.
5. **History Tracking**: Maintains a detailed history of changes for easy rollbacks.
