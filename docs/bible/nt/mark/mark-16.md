# Mark 16

***


###### 1 
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body. 

###### 2 
Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 

###### 3 
and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" 

###### 4 
But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 

###### 5 
As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 

###### 6 
"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 

###### 7 
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'" 

###### 8 
Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. [The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9â€“20.] _ 

###### 9 
When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene,_ _out of whom he had driven seven demons._ _ 

###### 10 
She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping._ _ 

###### 11 
When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it._ _ 

###### 12 
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country._ _ 

###### 13 
These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either._ _ 

###### 14 
Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen._ _ 

###### 15 
He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation._ _ 

###### 16 
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned._ _ 

###### 17 
And these signs_ _will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons;_ _they will speak in new tongues;_ _ 

###### 18 
they will pick up snakes_ _with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on_ _sick people, and they will get well."_ _ 

###### 19 
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven_ _and he sat at the right hand of God._ _ 

###### 20 
Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs_ _that accompanied it._
