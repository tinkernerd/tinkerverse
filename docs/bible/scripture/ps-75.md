# Psalms 75

***


###### 1 
We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds. 

###### 2 
You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity. 

###### 3 
When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. 

###### 4 
To the arrogant I say, 'Boast no more,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horns. 

###### 5 
Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.'" 

###### 6 
No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves. 

###### 7 
It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another. 

###### 8 
In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs. 

###### 9 
As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob, 

###### 10 
who says, "I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up."
