# Psalms 114

***


###### 1 
When Israel came out of Egypt, Jacob from a people of foreign tongue, 

###### 2 
Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

###### 3 
The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back; 

###### 4 
the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like lambs. 

###### 5 
Why was it, sea, that you fled? Why, Jordan, did you turn back? 

###### 6 
Why, mountains, did you leap like rams, you hills, like lambs? 

###### 7 
Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### 8 
who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.
