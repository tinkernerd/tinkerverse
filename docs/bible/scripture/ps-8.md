# Psalms 8

***


###### 1 
LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. 

###### 2 
Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. 

###### 3 
When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 

###### 4 
what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? 

###### 5 
You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. 

###### 6 
You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet: 

###### 7 
all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, 

###### 8 
the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. 

###### 9 
LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
