# Psalms 20

***


###### 1 
May the LORD answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. 

###### 2 
May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion. 

###### 3 
May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings. 

###### 4 
May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed. 

###### 5 
May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests. 

###### 6 
Now this I know: The LORD gives victory to his anointed. He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand. 

###### 7 
Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God. 

###### 8 
They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm. 

###### 9 
LORD, give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!
