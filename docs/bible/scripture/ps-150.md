# Psalms 150

***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens. 

###### 2 
Praise him for his acts of power; praise him for his surpassing greatness. 

###### 3 
Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre, 

###### 4 
praise him with timbrel and dancing, praise him with the strings and pipe, 

###### 5 
praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with resounding cymbals. 

###### 6 
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD.
