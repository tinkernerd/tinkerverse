# Psalms 124

***


###### 1 
If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel say-- 

###### 2 
if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us, 

###### 3 
they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us; 

###### 4 
the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, 

###### 5 
the raging waters would have swept us away. 

###### 6 
Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth. 

###### 7 
We have escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. 

###### 8 
Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
