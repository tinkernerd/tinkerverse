# Psalms 123

***


###### 1 
I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven. 

###### 2 
As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he shows us his mercy. 

###### 3 
Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt. 

###### 4 
We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud.
