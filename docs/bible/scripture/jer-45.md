# Jeremiah 45

***


###### 1 
When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch: 

###### 2 
"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: 

###### 3 
You said, 'Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.' 

###### 4 
But the LORD has told me to say to you, 'This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. 

###### 5 
Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'"
