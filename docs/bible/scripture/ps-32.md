# Psalms 32

***


###### 1 
Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 

###### 2 
Blessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit. 

###### 3 
When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 

###### 4 
For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. 

###### 5 
Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD." And you forgave the guilt of my sin. 

###### 6 
Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them. 

###### 7 
You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. 

###### 8 
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. 

###### 9 
Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you. 

###### 10 
Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him. 

###### 11 
Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!
