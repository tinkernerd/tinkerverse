# Psalms 129

***


###### 1 
"They have greatly oppressed me from my youth," let Israel say; 

###### 2 
"they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. 

###### 3 
Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long. 

###### 4 
But the LORD is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked." 

###### 5 
May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. 

###### 6 
May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow; 

###### 7 
a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms. 

###### 8 
May those who pass by not say to them, "The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."
