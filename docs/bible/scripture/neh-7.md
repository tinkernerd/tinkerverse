I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses." ## The List of the Exiles Who Returned

###### 61 
The following came up from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer, but they could not show that their families were descended from Israel: 

###### 63 
And from among the priests: 

###### 64 
These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 

###### 65 
The governor, therefore, ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there should be a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim. 

###### 66 
The whole company numbered 42,360, 

###### 67 
besides their 7,337 male and female slaves; and they also had 245 male and female singers. 

###### 68 
There were 736 horses, 245 mules, 

###### 69 
435 camels and 6,720 donkeys. 

###### 70 
Some of the heads of the families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 bowls and 530 garments for priests. 

###### 71 
Some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
