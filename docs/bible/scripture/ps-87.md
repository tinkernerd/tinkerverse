# Psalms 87

***


###### 1 
He has founded his city on the holy mountain. 

###### 2 
The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob. 

###### 3 
Glorious things are said of you, city of God: 

###### 4 
"I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me-- Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush-- and will say, 'This one was born in Zion.'" 

###### 5 
Indeed, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her." 

###### 6 
The LORD will write in the register of the peoples: "This one was born in Zion." 

###### 7 
As they make music they will sing, "All my fountains are in you."
