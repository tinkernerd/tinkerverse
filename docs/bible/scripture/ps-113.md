# Psalms 113

***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, you his servants; praise the name of the LORD. 

###### 2 
Let the name of the LORD be praised, both now and forevermore. 

###### 3 
From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the LORD is to be praised. 

###### 4 
The LORD is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens. 

###### 5 
Who is like the LORD our God, the One who sits enthroned on high, 

###### 6 
who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth? 

###### 7 
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; 

###### 8 
he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people. 

###### 9 
He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the LORD.
