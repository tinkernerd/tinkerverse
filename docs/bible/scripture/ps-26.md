# Psalms 26

***


###### 1 
Vindicate me, LORD, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the LORD and have not faltered. 

###### 2 
Test me, LORD, and try me, examine my heart and my mind; 

###### 3 
for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness. 

###### 4 
I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites. 

###### 5 
I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked. 

###### 6 
I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, LORD, 

###### 7 
proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds. 

###### 8 
LORD, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory dwells. 

###### 9 
Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with those who are bloodthirsty, 

###### 10 
in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes. 

###### 11 
I lead a blameless life; deliver me and be merciful to me. 

###### 12 
My feet stand on level ground; in the great congregation I will praise the LORD.
