# Psalms 115

***


###### 1 
Not to us, LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness. 

###### 2 
Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?" 

###### 3 
Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him. 

###### 4 
But their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands. 

###### 5 
They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. 

###### 6 
They have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. 

###### 7 
They have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats. 

###### 8 
Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. 

###### 9 
All you Israelites, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield. 

###### 10 
House of Aaron, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield. 

###### 11 
You who fear him, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield. 

###### 12 
The LORD remembers us and will bless us: He will bless his people Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron, 

###### 13 
he will bless those who fear the LORD-- small and great alike. 

###### 14 
May the LORD cause you to flourish, both you and your children. 

###### 15 
May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 

###### 16 
The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to mankind. 

###### 17 
It is not the dead who praise the LORD, those who go down to the place of silence; 

###### 18 
it is we who extol the LORD, both now and forevermore. Praise the LORD.
