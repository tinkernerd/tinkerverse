# Psalms 131

***


###### 1 
My heart is not proud, LORD, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. 

###### 2 
But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content. 

###### 3 
Israel, put your hope in the LORD both now and forevermore.
