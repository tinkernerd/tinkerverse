# Psalms 54

***


###### 1 
Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might. 

###### 2 
Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth. 

###### 3 
Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me-- people without regard for God. 

###### 4 
Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me. 

###### 5 
Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them. 

###### 6 
I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, LORD, for it is good. 

###### 7 
You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
