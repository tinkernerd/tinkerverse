# Psalms 92

***


###### 1 
It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High, 

###### 2 
proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, 

###### 3 
to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp. 

###### 4 
For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD; I sing for joy at what your hands have done. 

###### 5 
How great are your works, LORD, how profound your thoughts! 

###### 6 
Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand, 

###### 7 
that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. 

###### 8 
But you, LORD, are forever exalted. 

###### 9 
For surely your enemies, LORD, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. 

###### 10 
You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me. 

###### 11 
My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes. 

###### 12 
The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; 

###### 13 
planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God. 

###### 14 
They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, 

###### 15 
proclaiming, "The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him."
