# Psalms 142

***


###### 1 
I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. 

###### 2 
I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble. 

###### 3 
When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way. In the path where I walk people have hidden a snare for me. 

###### 4 
Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life. 

###### 5 
I cry to you, LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." 

###### 6 
Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 

###### 7 
Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
