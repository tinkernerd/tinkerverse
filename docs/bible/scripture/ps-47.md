# Psalms 47

***


###### 1 
Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy. 

###### 2 
For the LORD Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth. 

###### 3 
He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet. 

###### 4 
He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved. 

###### 5 
God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD amid the sounding of trumpets. 

###### 6 
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises. 

###### 7 
For God is the King of all the earth; sing to him a psalm of praise. 

###### 8 
God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne. 

###### 9 
The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
