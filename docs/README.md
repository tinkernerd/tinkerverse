# TinkerDocs

Feel Free to Explore! 

Howdy, I'm **Nick** or the Tinkering Nerd, This is my *2nd Brain,* *Digital Garden* and *Digital Notebook*. Some notes on here might change, some might stay static, and some just won't make sense. Check Notes (notes list) to see which are rubbish and which make sense. I may or may not have ADHD, so you'll see a bunch of different topics in here.   

Currently, I am a Student at [Southwestern Michigan College](https://swmich.edu) heading towards a degree in [Information Technology.](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_technology) You'll see notes in here for programming, Including Python, PowerShell, or whatever I start and maybe finish. I also have notes on Docker, Raspberry pi's, 3D printing, Networking, Recipes, GitHub, Aviation, and what not.
