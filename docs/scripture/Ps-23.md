# Psalms 23

***


###### 1 
The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 

###### 2 
He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 

###### 3 
he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake. 

###### 4 
Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

###### 5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 

###### 6 
Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
