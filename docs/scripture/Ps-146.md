# Psalms 146

***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, my soul. 

###### 2 
I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. 

###### 3 
Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save. 

###### 4 
When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing. 

###### 5 
Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD their God. 

###### 6 
He is the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them-- he remains faithful forever. 

###### 7 
He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets prisoners free, 

###### 8 
the LORD gives sight to the blind, the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down, the LORD loves the righteous. 

###### 9 
The LORD watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked. 

###### 10 
The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the LORD.
