# Psalms 128

***


###### 1 
Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in obedience to him. 

###### 2 
You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours. 

###### 3 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. 

###### 4 
Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the LORD. 

###### 5 
May the LORD bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. 

###### 6 
May you live to see your children's children-- peace be on Israel.
