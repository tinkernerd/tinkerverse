# Psalms 24

***


###### 1 
The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; 

###### 2 
for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters. 

###### 3 
Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place? 

###### 4 
The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god. 

###### 5 
They will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from God their Savior. 

###### 6 
Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob. 

###### 7 
Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 

###### 8 
Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 

###### 9 
Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 

###### 10 
Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD Almighty-- he is the King of glory.
