# Psalms 30

***


###### 1 
I will exalt you, LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. 

###### 2 
LORD my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me. 

###### 3 
You, LORD, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit. 

###### 4 
Sing the praises of the LORD, you his faithful people; praise his holy name. 

###### 5 
For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. 

###### 6 
When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken." 

###### 7 
LORD, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed. 

###### 8 
To you, LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy: 

###### 9 
"What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness? 

###### 10 
Hear, LORD, and be merciful to me; LORD, be my help." 

###### 11 
You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, 

###### 12 
that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever.
