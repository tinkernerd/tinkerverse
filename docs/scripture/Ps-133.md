# Psalms 133

***


###### 1 
How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity! 

###### 2 
It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robe. 

###### 3 
It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.
