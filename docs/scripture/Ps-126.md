# Psalms 126

***


###### 1 
When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. 

###### 2 
Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 

###### 3 
The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. 

###### 4 
Restore our fortunes, LORD, like streams in the Negev. 

###### 5 
Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. 

###### 6 
Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
