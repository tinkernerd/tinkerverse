# Psalms 13

***


###### 1 
How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

###### 2 
How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me? 

###### 3 
Look on me and answer, LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death, 

###### 4 
and my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall. 

###### 5 
But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. 

###### 6 
I will sing the LORD's praise, for he has been good to me.
