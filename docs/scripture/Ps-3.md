# Psalms 3

***


###### 1 
LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! 

###### 2 
Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him." 

###### 3 
But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high. 

###### 4 
I call out to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy mountain. 

###### 5 
I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me. 

###### 6 
I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side. 

###### 7 
Arise, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. 

###### 8 
From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.
