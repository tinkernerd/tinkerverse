# Psalms 84

***


###### 1 
How lovely is your dwelling place, LORD Almighty! 

###### 2 
My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 

###### 3 
Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young-- a place near your altar, LORD Almighty, my King and my God. 

###### 4 
Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. 

###### 5 
Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 

###### 6 
As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. 

###### 7 
They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. 

###### 8 
Hear my prayer, LORD God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob. 

###### 9 
Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one. 

###### 10 
Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. 

###### 11 
For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. 

###### 12 
LORD Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.
