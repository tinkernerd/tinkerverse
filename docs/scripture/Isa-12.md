# Isaiah 12

***


###### 1 
In that day you will say: "I will praise you, LORD. Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me. 

###### 2 
Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD himself, is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation." 

###### 3 
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. 

###### 4 
In that day you will say: "Give praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted. 

###### 5 
Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world. 

###### 6 
Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you."
