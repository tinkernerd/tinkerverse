# Psalms 111

***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD. I will extol the LORD with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly. 

###### 2 
Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them. 

###### 3 
Glorious and majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever. 

###### 4 
He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and compassionate. 

###### 5 
He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever. 

###### 6 
He has shown his people the power of his works, giving them the lands of other nations. 

###### 7 
The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy. 

###### 8 
They are established for ever and ever, enacted in faithfulness and uprightness. 

###### 9 
He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant forever-- holy and awesome is his name. 

###### 10 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.
