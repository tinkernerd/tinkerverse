# 1 Timothy 3

***


###### 1 
Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 

###### 2 
Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 

###### 3 
not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 

###### 4 
He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. 

###### 5 
(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) 

###### 6 
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 

###### 7 
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap. 

###### 8 
In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 

###### 9 
They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 

###### 10 
They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. 

###### 11 
In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. 

###### 12 
A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 

###### 13 
Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. ## Reasons for Paul's Instructions 

###### 14 
Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, 

###### 15 
if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 

###### 16 
Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
