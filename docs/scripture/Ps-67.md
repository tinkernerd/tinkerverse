# Psalms 67

***


###### 1 
May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us-- 

###### 2 
so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations. 

###### 3 
May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. 

###### 4 
May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth. 

###### 5 
May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. 

###### 6 
The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us. 

###### 7 
May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.
