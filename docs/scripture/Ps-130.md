# Psalms 130

***


###### 1 
Out of the depths I cry to you, LORD; 

###### 2 
Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. 

###### 3 
If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 

###### 4 
But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you. 

###### 5 
I wait for the LORD, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope. 

###### 6 
I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 

###### 7 
Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. 

###### 8 
He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
