# Psalms 14

***


###### 1 
The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. 

###### 2 
The LORD looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. 

###### 3 
All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. 

###### 4 
Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the LORD. 

###### 5 
But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous. 

###### 6 
You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. 

###### 7 
Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
