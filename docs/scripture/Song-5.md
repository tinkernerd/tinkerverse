# Song of Solomon 5

***


###### 1 
I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; drink your fill of love. 

###### 2 
I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night." 

###### 3 
I have taken off my robe-- must I put it on again? I have washed my feet-- must I soil them again? 

###### 4 
My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him. 

###### 5 
I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt. 

###### 6 
I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer. 

###### 7 
The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls! 

###### 8 
Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you-- if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love. 

###### 9 
How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you so charge us? 

###### 10 
My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand. 

###### 11 
His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven. 

###### 12 
His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels. 

###### 13 
His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh. 

###### 14 
His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli. 

###### 15 
His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars. 

###### 16 
His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
