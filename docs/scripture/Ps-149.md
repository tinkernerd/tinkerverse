# Psalms 149

***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people. 

###### 2 
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King. 

###### 3 
Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp. 

###### 4 
For the LORD takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory. 

###### 5 
Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds. 

###### 6 
May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, 

###### 7 
to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 

###### 8 
to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, 

###### 9 
to carry out the sentence written against them-- this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the LORD.
