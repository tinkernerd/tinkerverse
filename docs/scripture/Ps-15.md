# Psalms 15

***


###### 1 
LORD, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? 

###### 2 
The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart; 

###### 3 
whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others; 

###### 4 
who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the LORD; who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind; 

###### 5 
who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.
