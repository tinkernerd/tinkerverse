# Psalms 82

***


###### 1 
God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the "gods": 

###### 2 
"How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? 

###### 3 
Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. 

###### 4 
Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked. 

###### 5 
"The 'gods' know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 

###### 6 
"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.' 

###### 7 
But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler." 

###### 8 
Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.
