# Psalms 65

***


###### 1 
Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled. 

###### 2 
You who answer prayer, to you all people will come. 

###### 3 
When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. 

###### 4 
Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. 

###### 5 
You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas, 

###### 6 
who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength, 

###### 7 
who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. 

###### 8 
The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. 

###### 9 
You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. 

###### 10 
You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. 

###### 11 
You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. 

###### 12 
The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. 

###### 13 
The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
