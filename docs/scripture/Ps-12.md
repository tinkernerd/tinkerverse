# Psalms 12

***


###### 1 
Help, LORD, for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race. 

###### 2 
Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts. 

###### 3 
May the LORD silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue-- 

###### 4 
those who say, "By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us--who is lord over us?" 

###### 5 
"Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will protect them from those who malign them." 

###### 6 
And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold refined seven times. 

###### 7 
You, LORD, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked, 

###### 8 
who freely strut about when what is vile is honored by the human race.
