title: Bass Fishing Lure Selector Chart
---
## We answer the biggest question in bass fishing: when do I throw what bait?

The biggest question we get asked by anglers is when to throw what bait. And guys wanted to know if there was a chart you could go by on **when to fish bass fishing lures**.We organized the Wired2Fish Bass Fishing Lure Selector Chart by water temperature and water clarity. See if this helps you with some general ideas of when to throw what baits. Obviously experimentation is the key to fishing. So don't think these are the only baits, but it will give you a starting point and you can expand from there.Â
