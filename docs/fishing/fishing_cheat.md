## A Comprehensive Fishing Guide: Outfitting Your Trip and Matching Fish with Gear
_By Greg Schwipps with Peter Kaminsky_

To catch fish consistently, anglers need to know some things about the fish they pursue and the habitat where those fish reside. A prepared angler is often a successful angler, so you can use a chart to help you decide what to bring on your next fishing trip. For more preparation, you should know common catches and their usual haunts. And in case you ever catch a whopper, you can compare it to the world record holders according to the International Game Fish Association.

### Outfitting Your Fishing Trip with the Right Equipment and Clothing

No one checklist works for every fishing trip, as there are many variables to consider. Are you fishing saltwater or freshwater? What species are you fishing for? What’s the weather like? What season is it? Are you fishing from a boat or the bank?

This table is a broad list of things necessary for most trips, arranged in order from most to least crucial. Go through this list before each venture, skipping items that aren’t relevant for a particular trip. It should help you remember many of the items you need!

### Matching Up the Fish, the Water, and the Offering

Almost every sizable body of water, provided it isn’t too polluted, will have some fish in it. Whether the fish have been stocked there or appear through natural reproduction, there’s a good chance more than one species is present.

The following table lists a few common species of fish and provides typical habitats for them, as well as bait, lures, and flies that often trigger them to bite. These fish can be found in other habitats and will hit other offerings in addition to those listed.

### Matching Your Fishing Rod, Lure, and Line

Your fishing rod has a limit to how much weight it can lift and cast effectively. This is called the “power” of the rod. Anglers can use this chart as a guide to match up the right rod, lure weight, and line size for the right balance.

| Ultralight      | 1–4 lb test       | 1/64–1/16 oz       |
| Light           | 4–8 lb test       | 1/16–1/4 oz        |
| Medium Light    | 6–10 lb test      | 1/4–1/2 oz         |
| Medium          | 8–12 lb test      | 1/2–1 oz           |
| Medium Heavy    | 12–25 lb test     | 1–4 oz             |
