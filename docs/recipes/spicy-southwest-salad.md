### Ingredients

- 2  boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 4 stems cilantro
- 3 teaspoons garlic (minced)
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds ((or 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin)
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 ear corn
- 1 pint grape tomatoes (halved)
- 2  poblano peppers (seeded and chopped)
- 1  red bell pepper (seeded and chopped)
- 15 ounces canned black beans (drained and rinsed)
- 3 cups mixed greens
- 3 ounces Monterey Jack cheese (shredded)
- 3 ounces cheddar cheese (shredded)
- 1 cup tortilla strips
- 1/4 cup chili lime pepitas ((see note))
- 1/2 cup salsa
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper

### Instructions

- Put the chicken breasts into a gallon-size ziplock bag. Add the olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, and cumin seeds to the bag. Seal and smush around the chicken. Marinate for 1 hour.
- While the chicken is marinating, make the dressing by adding the dressing ingredients to a food processor or blender. Cover and purée. Pour it into a sealable container and refrigerate until ready to serve.
- Place a large skillet over high heat. Brush the corn with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast for 2 minutes per side. Then use a knife to cut the corn kernels off the cob. Set aside.
- Add the tomatoes, poblano, and bell pepper to the skillet and sauté for 5 minutes. Stir in the corn kernels and sauté for another 2 minutes.
- Add lettuce, tomato, bell pepper, poblano, corn, black beans, and shredded cheese to a large salad bowl and toss. (You can also make the salad in individual bowls, just divide the ingredients evenly between them.)
- Place a grill pan or cast iron skillet over high heat. Stir together the chicken seasoning ingredients in a small bowl.
- Remove the chicken from the marinade. Season both sides of each breast with seasoning. Place the chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound them to ½-inch thick using a meat mallet (or a rolling pin).
- Lightly spray the grill pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place chicken into the pan and cook for 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut it into thin slices.
- Place the chicken slices on top of the salad. Garnish with the tortilla strips and pepitas. Drizzle with dressing or serve it on the side.
