# Automation

Why do something yourself when a script can do it better, faster, and without complaining? This section is your go-to for automation tools and practices. We’re starting with Ansible, but there’s plenty more to come, so keep an eye out.

## Topics

- [Ansible](./ansible.md)

## Coming Soon

- **Terraform**: Automate your infrastructure with the power of code.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipelines that’ll make your deployments smoother than a Zamboni’d ice rink.
- **Puppet**: Keeping your servers in line, like a drill sergeant.
- **PowerShell**: Automating your Windows systems like a pro.
