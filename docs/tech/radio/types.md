## MURS
### **What is MURS radio?**

MURS stands for **M**ulti **U**ser **R**adio **S**ervice. It uses a license-free group of **5 channels** in the 151–154 MHz spectrum range, which were previously in the industrial/business radio service and were known as the "color dot" frequencies in Part 90 of the FCC rules. Different from similar service GMRS, MURS is a l**ow-power**, **short-range**, **license-exempt** **personal** radio service.  
　

Channels 1–3 must be used with “narrowband” FM – (2.5 kHz deviation; 11.25 kHz bandwidth). Channels 4 and 5 may use either “wideband” FM – (5 kHz deviation; 20 kHz bandwidth) or “narrowband” FM. Source: [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/multi-use-radio-service-murs)  
  
MURS channels 4-5 are shared with some business band radios who are grandfathered in on these frequencies. Commercial radio manufacturers use a “color dot system” to identify different radio channels, hence the “Blue Dot” and “Green Dot” channels. CTCSS and DCS “privacy tones or codes” (which don’t actually provide privacy) are allowed on MURS.  
　

**What are the differences between MURS and [GMRS radios](https://www.radioddity.com/blogs/all/everything-you-want-to-know-about-gmrs-radio)?**

1. MURS radios are totally license-free to operate, while GMRS radios require an FCC license.  
2. MURS radios are less crowded.  
3. MURS radios are with fixed 2 Watts output. GMRS radios are capable of up to 50 Watts power output, which means a longer range communication possibility.  
4. MURS radios aren't able to hit repeaters for extending range, while some GMRS radios do.  
5. MURS radios don't work with FRS radios, while GMRS radios do.  
6. MURS radios are with fewer channels.  
　

**What are the differences between MURS and FRS radios?**

1. MURS radios are less crowded.  
2. MURS radios are allowed to use removable antennas, while FRS radios aren't.  
3. MURS radios transmit on the VHF band, which provides better coverage in rural and outdoor areas. FRS works better in urban environments.  
4. MURS radios don't work with GMRS radios, while FRS radios do.  
5. MURS radios are with fewer channels. Handheld FRS units may have up to 22 channels.
