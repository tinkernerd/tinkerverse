| PAN          | Personal Area Network is a network consisting of only a small number of devices owned by an individual.                                                                      |
| LAN          | A Local Area Network is a network that covers a small area (for example, a company’s network).                                                                               |
| WAN          | A Wide Area Network is a network that includes many devices and covers a large area. Usually collectively owned.                                                             |
| MAN          | MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network. It is a computer network that connects a findnumber of LANs to form a larger network so that the computer resources can be shared. |

<b>Networking Devices:</b>

| Device            | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client            | Any device, such as a workstation, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, that is used to access a network.         |
| Server            | Provides resources to network users, including email, web pages, or files.                                   |
| Hub               | A Layer 1 device that does not perform any inspection of traffic. A hub simply receives traffic in a port and repeats that traffic out of all the other ports. |
| Switch            | A Layer 2 device that makes its forwarding decisions based on the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address. A switch learns which devices reside off which ports by examining the source MAC address. The switch then forwards traffic only to the appropriate port, and not to all the other ports. |
| Router            | A Layer 3 device that makes forwarding decisions based on Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. Based on the routing table, the router intelligently forwards the traffic out of the appropriate interface. |
| Multilayer switch | Can operate at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Also called a Layer 3 switch, a multilayer switch is a high-performance device that can switch traffic within the LAN and forward packets between subnets. |
| Media             | Media can be copper cabling, fiber-optic cabling, or radio waves. Media varies in its cost, bandwidth capacity, and distance limitation. |
| Analog modem      | Modem is short for modulator/demodulator. An analog modem converts the digital signals generated by a computer into analog signals that can travel over conventional phone lines. |
| Broadband modem   | A digital modem used with high-speed DSL or cable Internet service. Both operate in a similar manner to the analog modem but use higher broadband frequencies and transmission speeds. |
| Access point (AP) | A network device with a built-in antenna, transmitter, and adapter that provides a connection point between WLANs and a wired Ethernet LAN. APs usually have several wired RJ-45 ports to support LAN clients. Most small office or home office (SOHO) routers integrate an AP. |
