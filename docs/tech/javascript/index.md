# JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript section! Here’s where I keep all the important notes and examples from class, as well as some project links and resources. Whether you're here to brush up on functions or dive into class materials, you’re in the right spot.

## Class Notes

Checkout the [Git Repo for ISYS115](https://github.com/tinkernerd/ISYS115) for all the code from class. Important notes and examples from the course will make their way here over time.

## Info-Tech and Classes

If you’re bouncing between sections, you may notice the [Info-Tech](/tech/index.md) section is a bit of a mishmash right now, but I’m working on separating content by [Classes](../..//classes/index.md) to keep things more organized.

### Topics Covered

- [JavaScript Basics](/basics.md)
- [Functions](functions.md)
- [DOM Manipulation](dom_manipulation.md)
- [APIs](apis.md)
- [Asynchronous JavaScript](async.md)

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to add content from class and personal projects.
