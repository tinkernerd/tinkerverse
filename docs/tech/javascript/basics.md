# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for enhancing web pages. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the basics:

## Topics Covered

- **Variables**: Use `let`, `const`, and `var` to store data.
- **Data Types**: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects, Arrays.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators.
- **Control Flow**: `if` statements, `switch` cases, loops (`for`, `while`, etc.).

Basic JavaScript is foundational for building more complex logic. Understanding how to manipulate variables and control flow will help you get started with more advanced topics.
