# Front-Facing Documentation Sites

Front-facing documentation sites are an excellent way to showcase notes, projects, or general knowledge in an accessible and visually appealing format. These sites often serve as personal knowledge bases, public-facing documentation for projects, or even digital gardens where ideas grow and evolve.

## Why Create a Front-Facing Documentation Site?

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share your expertise or resources with a broader audience.
2. **Organization**: Maintain a structured and navigable repository of your notes and documentation.
3. **Version Control**: Track changes and updates seamlessly with Git.
4. **Customization**: Personalize the design and functionality to reflect your style or branding.
5. **Discoverability**: Make your content accessible to others via search engines or shared links.
