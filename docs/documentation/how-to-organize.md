# How to Organize Documentation

Organized documentation is easier to navigate, understand, and maintain. Structure your content logically to enhance its usability.

## Organizational Methods
1. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - Group content into categories and subcategories.
   - Example: A table of contents or folder structure.

2. **Chronological**
   - Use dates for progress logs or project timelines.

3. **Tagging and Metadata**
   - Use tags like `project`, `notes`, or `reference` for quick filtering.
   - Add metadata (e.g., title, date, type) to enrich content.

4. **Indexing**
   - Create an index or search functionality for easy lookup.

## Tools to Help
- **Obsidian**: Organize notes with links and tags.
- **Docusaurus**: Create structured documentation websites.
- **GitHub Wiki**: Host and organize team knowledge.

## Example Structure
```plaintext
Documentation/
├── Getting Started
├── User Guides
├── API Documentation
└── Release Notes
```

Start organizing your notes with [Markdown for Obsidian](./md-obsidian).
