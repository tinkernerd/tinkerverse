Here is where I keep my class or course notes. Currently I have just my ISYS 115 (JavaScript) notes and links to projects in there and my ENST 112 (Environmental Sci), which has my notes and homework. 
<br>
Important notes for 115 will end up in [JavaScript](/tech/javascript/index.md) since that is more specialized. If anyone actually reads this, feel free to [contact me](/resources/contact.md).
