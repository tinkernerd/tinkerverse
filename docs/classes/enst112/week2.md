# ENST 112 Environmental Science

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Environmental Science

### What is Environmental Science?
- **Definition**: Environmental science is the branch of science that deals with how the natural world functions, how the environment affects humans, and how humans impact the environment.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Solve environmental problems.
  - Apply scientific knowledge.
- **Interdisciplinary Nature**:
  - **Natural sciences**: Focus on examining the natural world (e.g., biology, chemistry).
  - **Social sciences**: Focus on human interactions and institutions (e.g., sociology, political science).
  - **Environmental Studies**: An academic program that integrates natural and social sciences.

### The History of Environmental Science in the US
- **1st Wave (1780s - 1800s)**: Focused on westward expansion and resource use.
- **2nd Wave (Late 1800s)**: Industrialization and conservation efforts.
- **3rd Wave (1900s)**: Major environmental protection movements, policies, and regulations.

### Key US Environmental Laws
- **1963**: Clean Air Act
- **1964**: Wilderness Act
- **1965**: Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act
- **1968**: Wild and Scenic Rivers Act
- **1970**: National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the first Earth Day.
- **1972**: Marine Mammal Protection Act, Federal Pesticide Act
- **1973**: Endangered Species Act
- **1974**: Safe Drinking Water Act
- **1976**: Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
- **1980**: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or "Superfund")

### International Environmental Coordination
- **Key Organizations**:
  - United Nations (UN)
  - World Bank
  - World Trade Organization (WTO)
  - Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs)

### Global Environmental Challenges
1. **Overpopulation**: Overuse of resources.
2. **Ecosystem Decline**: Degradation of ecosystems.
3. **Loss of Biodiversity**: Species extinction.
4. **Global Atmospheric Changes**: Climate change, ozone depletion, etc.

## Sustainability

### What is Sustainability?
- **Definition**: A guiding principle of environmental science focused on conserving resources, maintaining functional ecological systems, and developing long-term solutions to support both human civilization and all life on Earth.

### How Can We Achieve Sustainability?
- **Triple Bottom Line**:
  - **Economic Advancement**
  - **Environmental Protection**
  - **Social Equity**
