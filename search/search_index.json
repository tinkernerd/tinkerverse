Lift is the force that acts upward, against gravity. Thrust propels the airplane forward, and drag acts opposite of thrust.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Swiss mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli, found that, as the speed of the air increases, its pressure will decrease.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The upper surface of a wing is curved and the lower surface is relatively flat. As air flow meets the wing, the air flowing over the top curve, or camber, increases speed decreasing the pressure on top of the wing. This decreased pressure is the major source of the lift needed to make the airplane fly.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The front part of a wing is called the leading edge and the back is called the trailing edge. In cross section, an imaginary line drawn between the leading edge and the trailing edge is called the wing chord.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An airplane has three axis of movement \u2013 the longitudinal axis which passes through the length of the airplane, the lateral axis which passes through the wings, and the vertical axis, which passes through the body of the airplane perpendicular to the other two axes.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To maneuver an airplane you must control its movement around these three axes. This is done by moving the primary control surfaces \u2013 the elevator, ailerons, and rudder.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ailerons control roll, pitch is controlled by the elevator, and the rudder controls yaw.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pulling the yoke back moves the elevator to rotate the airplane around the lateral axis pitching the nose up. Pushing the yoke forward pitches the nose down.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning the control yoke moves the ailerons. Turn it right, right aileron is up and the left one is down, and the airplane banks right. Move the control yoke left and the left aileron is up and the right one is down, banking the airplane to the left. The bank will normally continue to increase until the ailerons are returned to the neutral position.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Pushing the right rudder pedal moves the rudder to the right and the airplane\u2019s nose yaws to the right. Push the left rudder, and the nose goes left. Yawing the nose is not necessarily turning the airplane.</p> </li> <li> <p>In turning flight, the rudder's function is to counteract adverse yaw which occurs when the airplane is rolled into a turn and when it's rolled back to wings level flight.</p> </li> <li> <p>A trim tab is used to relieve the pressure needed to hold a primary control surface out of the streamlined position. In many cases, elevator trim can be adjusted in flight. In some airplanes it can only be adjusted on the ground.</p> </li> <li> <p>The flaps are the movable panels on the trailing edge of the inboard parts of the wings. Both flaps are extended and retracted at the same time. Lowering the flaps increases both lift and drag.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extending the flaps allows the landing approach to be steeper and slower.

The white arc is the flaps operating range.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The vertical speed indicator measures the rate of climb, or descent, in feet per minute. The altimeter measures the altitude, or height, of the airplane above sea level.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An altimeter has three hands, just like a clock.

Therefore, the altimeter must be set prior to every flight to field elevation before takeoff.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The attitude indicator is a gyroscopic instrument.

Because the heading indicator is gyroscopically stabilized, it's not affected by banks, turns, and speed changes. However, the heading indicator must be set to the compass indication before takeoff and periodically adjusted to the compass indication while the airplane is in steady, level flight.</p> </li> <li> <p>The turn coordinator, a gyroscopic instrument, provides information about the direction and rate of the turn.

The full list of alphabet and numeral phonetics can be found in the Aeronautical Information Manual.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the individual numerals are pronounced the same way you would pronounce them in a non-aviation setting. A few use a special pronunciation to ensure clarity over the radio. Nine is pronounced niner, five should sound like fife, and three is articulated as tree.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Altitudes, ceiling heights, and other large numbers are indicated as hundreds and thousands in round numbers. A ceiling height of ninety-five hundred feet would be indicated as \"niner thousand fife hundred.\"</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For numbers at or higher than ten thousand feet, you should pronounce the individual digits for the thousands and hundreds if appropriate. When reporting an altitude of twelve thousand five hundred, say \"one two thousand fife hundred.\"</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While VFR operations are not permitted, altitudes above eighteen thousand feet are indicated as a flight level. Each digit of the flight level is pronounced when on the radio. Twenty-three thousand feet would be spoken as \"flight level two tree zero.\"</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The individual digits of a radio frequency should also be enunciated. The decimal point should be spoken as \"point\"; for example, \"one two two point one.\"</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three digits of a bearing, course, heading, or wind direction should be spoken individually. Directions on the radio are in relation to magnetic unless the word \"true\" is added to the transmission.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 Time may be expressed as Coordinated Universal Time or in the local time zone. The use of the \"zulu\" description may be used but is not required. The word \"local\" or the time zone equivalent would be used to denote when the time is not UTC.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 As a general rule, most other numbers are transmitted by pronouncing each digit. An exception to this is in the description of airways used in IFR flying. Here V12 is pronounced \"Victor twelve.\"</p> <p>12.\u00a0 Another exception would be for ATC traffic position reports. These are given in reference to the clock face.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 ATC traffic reports are in relation to the track rather than the nose of the airplane because radar does not show your crab angle.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 Words like Roger and Affirmative are not interchangeable. Each has a unique meaning in radio communications. \"Roger\" means that I have received all of your last transmission. It should not be used to answer a question requiring a yes or a no answer. \"Affirmative\" and \"Negative\" are used for yes and no, respectively.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 Wilco is similar in meaning to Roger. \"Wilco\" means I have received your message, understand it, and \"will comply\" with it.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 Most training airplanes are noisy and you'll be concentrating on flying.

To assure you're heard clearly over the extraneous sounds, position the microphone close to your lips, press the push-to-talk button and speak in a normal, but firm voice.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 The person you're talking to is a human being. If you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world.

UNICOM is an acronym for unified communications, and it's available at most airports which do not have a control tower.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 You can request airport advisory information on the UNICOM frequency. Calls to UNICOM are made by using the airport name and the word UNICOM. For example \"Clermont UNICOM.\" You should be aware that a UNICOM station is not always attended.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 The generic term for the radio channel to use at airports without an operating control tower is common traffic advisory frequency.

Parasite drag is caused by the fuselage and other protrusions disrupting the flow of air. Drag opposes thrust.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the airplane is in a steady climb or descent, you can further break down the forces of lift, weight, thrust, and drag into their horizontal and vertical components.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the airspeed is decreasing, the rearward forces are greater than the forward forces.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The angle of attack is the angle between the chord of the wing and the relative wind. Simply stated, angle of attack is the angle between where the wing is pointed and where it's actually going. Don't confuse the angle of attack with the pitch attitude of the airplane.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By changing the angle of attack, you control and change airspeed, lift, and drag.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At a low angle of attack, most of the lift is caused by the decrease in pressure above the wing. As the angle of attack increases, the lift caused by the higher pressure below the wing increases. Eventually the angle of attack becomes so large that the airflow can't flow over the top of the wing.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When this happens the airfoil has reached the stalling angle of attack, sometimes called the critical angle of attack or the burble point.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rotary motion of the air which flows from the wingtip is called a wingtip vortex. Wingtip vortices are a by-product of lift and increase in intensity as lift increases.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 Vortices are greatest when you have a relatively high angle of attack, for example on takeoff and landing. They diminish somewhat at cruise speed.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 A wing\u2019s center of lift can be thought of as the point where all the lift acts. In actual practice, to determine the center of the wings lifting force, you must also consider the pressures below the wing.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 As you increase the angle of attack, airflow separation moves toward the front of the wing. For example, at minimal controllable airspeed, any increase in angle of attack or load factor, or any reduction in power, will result in an immediate stall.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 The turbulent airflow spreads forward and outward from the wing root.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 As the wing is stalled, lift diminishes rapidly. Air flow is turbulent farther outboard on the wing, but the wing tips are still providing lift. The ailerons continue to have some effectiveness so some roll control remains.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 That the wing stalls progressively from the wing root outward toward the wing tip, is advantageous.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 The stall progresses this way because of modern wing design. For example, the wing is attached to the fuselage at an angle, called the angle of incidence. Also, the wing is slightly twisted, called washout. These design characteristics allows the outboard portion of the wing to have a lower angle of attack while the inboard part of the wing is at the stalling angle of attack.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 An airplane tends to turn left when using high power at low speeds. Viewed from the pilot's seat, the crankshaft and propeller on American made engines turn clockwise.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Engine torque, the tendency of the airplane to turn opposite the propeller rotation, spiraling slipstream, gyroscopic precession, and asymmetrical propeller loading all contribute to make the airplane turn left.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 The spiraling slipstream or corkscrew effect is caused by high propeller speed and is most pronounced at low forward speeds. The propeller rotation causes the slipstream to rotate clockwise around the fuselage striking the vertical stabilizer on the left side making the nose yaw to the left.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 The propeller acts like a gyroscope in that a force applied to the propeller becomes apparent ninety degrees from the point where it was applied.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 P-factor, asymmetric propeller loading, occurs when you fly the airplane at a high angle of attack.

The nose simply pitches away from the pilot.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 The main elements that determine the angle of attack of a wing are airspeed, weight, and load factor.</p> <p>27.\u00a0 Without an increased load factor, the normal weight of the airplane is 1-G. The previously discussed stalls were done at 1 G or only slightly more in turning stalls.</p> <p>28.\u00a0 An increase in weight or an increase in load factor will cause the airplane to stall at a higher speed.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 Stalls caused by an increased load factor are called accelerated stalls. They occur during a steep turn or an abrupt pitch change.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 With power reduced, the airplane should be slowed to a speed one and one half times the normal stall speed in straight flight.

This is unlike in the sideslip in which the airplane is pointed down the runway.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 The forward slip turns the airplane's fuselage into the relative wind, creating a high drag, which produces a high rate of descent.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 Lower a wing to one side or the other, yaw the nose of the airplane in the opposite direction through the use of opposite rudder. Raise the nose a little to control airspeed. Close to the ground, level the wings and head the airplane down the runway.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 If there is a crosswind you will have to transition into a sideslip before your wheels touchdown.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 If you are low on final approach, apply power and raise the nose to increase lift and stop the descent.

Many non-tower airports in the U.S. have automated weather information available to the pilot. You can locate the frequency in the Chart Supplement, on your sectional, or in your GPS. The wind report may give you an idea of which runway is in use.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The weather reporting system will typically update the message on a minute by minute basis. If the weather is changing, the broadcast will be updated quickly.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The system may also have a provision for the airport operator to record NOTAMs that directly affect the airport. This can also be used for weather information that may not be easily discernible by the automated system.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CTAF frequency can be found the same way as the weather frequency. Listen to it for a few minutes to determine what other pilots are doing in the area.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CTAF is an acronym for Common Traffic Advisory Frequency. It allows pilots to communicate their intentions in the environment of a non-towered airport.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At many airports, CTAF and UNICOM are the same frequency. The CTAF frequency on the sectional is indicated by a circle with a \"C\" in the center.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 To give an advisory of your intention and position, call on CTAF by starting your communication with \"Georgetown traffic.\" If you want information regarding the airport and its environment, call on the UNICOM frequency with the phrase, \"Georgetown UNICOM.\"</p> <p>11.\u00a0 The CTAF frequency is not for casual chatter between the pilots of different aircraft or personnel on the ground. Non-essential communication on this frequency may block an important radio call that is critical to someone's safety.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 You should not transmit the phrase \"Traffic in the area, please advise\" to determine the active runway. This will only tend to clog the frequency without serving the intended purpose. Listening is much more effective.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 If the airport doesn't have a weather reporting station and no communications are heard on CTAF, call UNICOM for a landing advisory.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 If you know the active runway without the call to UNICOM, make your initial call on the CTAF frequency about ten miles out.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 Adding the name of the airport at the end of the transmission is optional but can be useful for advising others in the area where you are located. CTAF frequencies are used for multiple airports and this can be confusing.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 Shortened call signs are acceptable provided that your aircraft won't be confused with another on the frequency.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Departure from a non-towered field begins on the ramp. Listen to the automated weather broadcast if available to determine the winds and potential active. Listen to the local CTAF frequency to ascertain what other aircraft in the vicinity of the airport are doing.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 The transponder is a useful communication device. It provides your aircraft with a higher degree of safety in an increasingly complex environment.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 Monitor the CTAF frequency during your taxi to the active runway but recognize that not all airport users may be using a radio. Keep your eyes open.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 Scan the area for traffic before announcing your departure. If all is clear, complete your lineup checks, including turning your transponder to altitude, announce your departure, scan the area again, and taxi onto the runway.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 \"Position and hold\" or \"lineup and wait\" should not be used at a non-towered airport.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 \"Closed traffic\" would indicate that you plan to remain in the traffic pattern at the Clermont County airport. After takeoff, you would call your turn to crosswind and successive legs as before.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 There are only two standard traffic pattern departures for non-towered airports: Straight-out and a forty-five degree turn in the direction of the pattern.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 Using a standard departure helps to improve safety at this type of air field.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 Your ultimate direction of flight should be included in your departure call.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 Correct communication is safety insurance.

To make a uniform circle on the ground, you must vary the bank angle and crab to compensate for the wind.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before beginning s-turns across a road, practice doing a 360 degree circle using bank angle and crab to correct for wind drift.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Center the circle on some point on the ground. Start the turn directly downwind. To compensate for the faster groundspeed, you'll need a steep bank here. Turning from the direct tailwind, the bank will be lessened progressively until you are upwind where the wings are almost level. As the turn continues, the bank increases to its steepest point when it is headed downwind.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In s-turns across a road, the airplane makes semi circles of equal size on each side of a straight line on the ground. This line should be at a right angle to the wind. Roads, railroad tracks, or fence lines can be used.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Start the maneuver at a right angle to the road. Begin a 180 degree turn and trace a uniform semi- circle over the ground. Coming back over the road, your wings should be level. Now turn in the opposite direction and trace an identical semi circle on the other side. The maneuver is finished when the airplane is again wings level over the road.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Try to start the maneuver downwind, wings level, crossing the road so your first bank is the steepest. As the semi-circle continues, the bank is lessened. When crosswind, a crab is utilized to correct for the wind.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the midpoint, pick a spot to cross the road in order to keep the semi circle uniform. From the midpoint on, bank and crab are decreased, so that when crossing the road wings level, the airplane is headed at a right angle.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, pick the spot where you want the airplane to be halfway around the upwind semi circle. The moment the road is crossed start a turn in the opposite direction. With a direct headwind the bank will be shallowest. As the wind changes from headwind to crosswind, start to steepen the bank.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 Halfway around the upwind semi circle, the airplane has turned less than 90 degrees and has the maximum crab into the wind. Pick the spot where you want to cross the road. As the wind becomes a tailwind, steepen the bank to finish the 180 degrees of turn over the road.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 In doing turns around a point you're putting the two halves of the s-turn together to trace a full circle on the ground.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 The maneuver consists in making two or more complete circles at a constant altitude, while maintaining a constant distance from a point on the ground.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 The point you choose should be prominent. A fence line, intersection, or the center of a crossroads is ideal because you can easily project ahead every 90 degrees.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 The bank should not exceed 45 degrees, so start on a downwind heading where groundspeed is highest and maximum bank is necessary.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 The bank and crab control is the same as used in s-turns.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 Your second turn is a repetition of the first.

A cumulonimbus cloud is a cumulus cloud which is producing precipitation \u2013 expect a bumpy flight with good crisp visibility. Rain or snow is usually heavy and localized. They indicate that the air is unstable, thus the bumpy ride.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The earth has an atmosphere around it. The first layer of the atmosphere is the troposphere, extending from the surface to approximately 40,000 feet. At the top of the troposphere, the tropopause marks the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In an inversion, the temperature increases with altitude and results in a stable atmosphere. Inversions cause low visibilities by trapping fog, smoke, dust, and other pollutants close to the surface.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two moisture related weather conditions are fog and thunderstorms.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evaporation, condensation, sublimation, deposition, freezing, or melting change water from vapor to liquid to ice or back the other way.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 Condensation is the process which makes invisible water vapor appear as clouds or liquid drops.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 The amount of water vapor in the air is largely dependent upon the air's temperature. Cold air contains less water vapor, warm air more.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 Relative humidity is the relationship between the amount of water vapor in the air in comparison to the maximum amount that could exist at that temperature.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 The temperature at which relative humidity reaches one hundred percent is called the dew point. At the dew point, air becomes saturated with water vapor.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 If the temperature and dew point get within three degrees or less of each other, clouds or fog, may form.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 Fog is formed by either the addition of moisture to the air, or cooling the air to the dew point, or a combination of the two working together.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 Radiation fog, called ground fog, forms on a clear, cold night when the surface of the earth is cooled by radiation until the temperature of the air near the surface is below initial dew point. Cooling of the air causes fog to form. Light winds deepen the fog while stronger winds tend to disperse it.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Advection fog, sometimes called sea fog, occurs mostly along coasts and is caused by wind transporting warm moist air to a colder surface. Winter advection fog, caused by strong southerly winds off the Gulf of Mexico, may cover the eastern U.S \u2013 as far north as the Great Lakes. Light to moderate winds deepen the fog while strong winds lift the fog forming low stratus clouds.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Upslope fog is caused by wind forcing moist stable air up a sloping land surface. Moist unstable air forced upward by mountain lift, called orographic lift, will form cumulus clouds instead of fog.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 Precipitation induced fog is caused by the evaporation of rain or drizzle. It can form rapidly over a large area and persist for an extended period.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 Ice fog forms in conditions similar to the conditions favorable for radiation fog, with the difference being that extremely cold temperatures exist.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 Calm or light winds are favorable for fog formation. Higher wind speeds tend to mix the air and prevent its cooling to the dew point. Fog is apt to form when the temperature-dew point spread is small. Dense fog is more likely in urban industrial areas than in rural areas since condensation nuclei are typically more abundant there. Finally, be alert for cooling processes, such as onshore winds at night, radiational cooling of land during clear nights, or upslope winds.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 At sea level on an average day, the atmosphere exerts a force of 14.7 pounds per square inch. At 18,000 feet, the pressure is approximately one half, or 7.32 pounds per square inch.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 The term standard day is defined as one in which the temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure, at sea level, is 29.92 inches of mercury. From there, temperature and pressure decrease at a standard rate as you go upward in the atmosphere.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 The altimeter measures the change in atmospheric pressure and reads it out in feet of altitude. Atmospheric pressure drops approximately 1 inch of mercury for every 1,000 feet of altitude below 10,000 feet. Therefore, it's important to reset the altimeter periodically as you fly to keep it accurate.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 Temperature affects the altimeter because the atmosphere expands and contracts with changes in temperature. Cold temperatures make the atmosphere contract. Remember, \"High temperatures to low, look out below.\" Look out below because the aircraft is lower than the altimeter indicates.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 The reverse of high to low is also true.

Therefore, lift equals weight in steady unaccelerated flight.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lateral or roll stability is usually achieved by dihedral. Positive dihedral occurs when the wing tips are somewhat higher than the wing root.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 In a bank, the lowered wing has a higher angle of attack and produces more lift because of dihedral. This will return the airplane to a wings level position.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 Another aspect of weight and balance theory is yaw or vertical axis stability. It's a function of the side area of the fuselage and the size of the vertical stabilizer.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 The airplane will yaw around its center of gravity (CG). The side area of the fuselage and vertical stabilizer is greater aft of the CG, making the airplane weathervane back to its original direction.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 An aft center of gravity will reduce the area behind the CG. This makes the airplane somewhat less directionally stable.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 Improper loading of the airplane can affect the stability on all three axes, but has the greatest effect on longitudinal or pitch stability.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 The CG must fall within a certain range. On the Skyhawk for example, at maximum weight, this allowable range is 7.4 inches. Passengers, baggage, fuel, and other items</p> <p>loaded in the airplane must be placed to keep it longitudinally balanced within these 7.4 inches.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 If the loaded center of gravity is aft of the allowable range, pitch stability will be reduced. Elevator control forces become lighter, and the airplane will tend to wander from level flight, pitching steeper up or down.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Loaded this way, if stalled, the airplane would remain in the stalled pitch attitude.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Loading the airplane with the center of gravity forward of the allowable range will increase longitudinal stability, calling for more elevator pressure to make pitch changes. In this situation, there might not be enough elevator control to flare for landing.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 A forward CG also results in a higher stall speed and lower performance in all areas.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 The weight of the airplane must not exceed its maximum allowable weight. This will cause higher stall speeds, longer takeoff distance, lower rate of climb, and a longer landing roll.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch3/#flight-service-weather-briefings","title":"Flight Service Weather Briefings","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 3 \u2013 Video Segment 22</p> <p>In this section we'll look at the weather briefing services offered by Flight Service and how you can use this to supplement own personal weather briefing.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch3/#review_21","title":"Review:","text":"<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flight service provides access to trained specialists who provide plain language preflight and in-flight weather briefings - often times with insight and local knowledge not found with commercial providers.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You can reach the flight service station serving your area by dialing 1-800-WX-BRIEF.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are three types of preflight briefings available from flight service stations.

Once in the middle of the runway, check to ensure the heading indicator and runway headings are the same.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 It will seem like you're moving faster than usual because you have no normal visual cues as in daylight.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 The location of navigation lights on an aircraft will help you determine the direction of the other aircraft. If you see a red light, you have the left wingtip in view and it's passing from your right to your left and has the right-of-way. If you see a white light and a flashing red or white light, you are looking at the tail of an airplane. A green light indicates you are seeing an airplane's right wing and it is moving from your left to right, and you have the right-of-way. An aircraft displaying both red and green lights will be approaching head on.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Regulations state that navigation lights must be on anytime an airplane is taxiing or flying during the entire period from sunset to sunrise.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 Night is defined as the time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 At night, it's important to know your position at all times when away from the airport.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 Some airports have radio controlled runway lights. Click the microphone 7 times within 5 seconds to activate the highest intensity lights available. Once activated, they remain illuminated for 15 minutes.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 Keep the runway lights in sight as you enter the pattern. Do your before landing checklist. Use the landing light to determine when to start your flare.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 Practice landing without a landing light as well \u2013 what if it burns out?</p> <p>24.\u00a0 A VASI system is a great help for night landing. Two bar VASI's can be seen from 3 to 5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles at night.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 When using a VASI, don't start your descent until the airplane is aligned with the runway.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 With the two bar VASI, if you see red over white, you are all right \u2013 meaning you are on the glidepath. Below the glidepath both bars would be red, and above the glidepath both bars would be white.</p> <p>27.\u00a0 A system with all light units installed in a single row is called a precision approach path indicator \u2013 PAPI. There are 2 and 4-light systems.</p> <p>28.\u00a0 For the two light system, if you are on the glidepath, you will see a combination of red and white. If both lights are white, you're too high. If you see all red, you're too low.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 A tri-color visual glide slope indicator is a single light unit that shows three colors. If you are on the glidepath you'll see green. Below the glidepath, you'll see red. Above the glidepath you'll see amber.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 During the night, you can experience many illusions which can lead to landing errors. For example, when landing over darkened areas it seems like the airplane is higher than it actually is. Straight lights along a road can be mistaken for runway lights.

With the switch pushed in, the Morse tones are suppressed, making it easier to hear voice transmissions.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 The VOR indicator has an Omni Bearing Selector, OBS, a Course Deviation Indicator, CDI, and a TO/FROM indicator.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 The Omni Bearing Selector is used to select the bearing, or course. When a course is selected, the course deviation indicator shows the position of the selected course.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 The CDI and the TO/FROM indicator are not affected by the heading of the airplane. At any location, if the CDI indicates the selected course is to the left, the CDI will remain pointing to the left no matter which way the airplane is pointed.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 If the needle is centered, the airplane is on a specific radial. You can read that course on the OBS. If, after setting the desired course into the OBS, the CDI is pointed to the right, the selected course is to the right. A needle to the left means the course is to the left. In both instances however, the airplane must be heading in the correct direction.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 A full scale deflection of the CDI represents 10 degrees. How far off course you are depends on your distance from the station. For example, a 5 degree deviation, 10 miles from the station, puts you about a mile off course. Thirty miles from the station, the same deviation puts you about 3 miles off course.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 The TO/FROM indicator shows whether the selected course will take the airplane to, or from the station. For example, from the north, on the 360 degree radial, a bearing of 180 degrees \"TO\" will take the airplane on a course to the station. The same course from the south will take the airplane from the station.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 To use the VOR to find your position, tune it to a nearby VOR station. Turn the OBS to center the CDI. Read the course from the OBS, and TO or FROM on the TO/FROM indicator. Now you can draw a line from the VOR. You know that you're located somewhere on that line.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 To find your position on the line, look for a landmark, or find your position in relation to another VOR.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 As you get closer to the VOR station, the heading corrections will become smaller because radials, like the spokes of a wheel, converge at the station.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 Within a few miles of the station you'll notice the CDI and the TO/FROM indicator flickering. The size of this cone of confusion is relatively small at low altitudes and increases with altitude. This flickering is not station passage. Station passage is indicated when the TO/FROM indicator makes the first complete reversal to a FROM indication.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 As you approach the VOR station, make small corrections to keep the CDI centered.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 A VORTAC, a VOR station in combination with a TACAN, has distance measuring capability \u2013 DME. Some DMEs show groundspeed and time to the station as well.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 A VOR receiver, used for instrument flight, must have been operationally checked for accuracy within the past 30 days.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 The Airport/Facility Directory lists designated ground and airborne receiver checkpoints. At these locations, a specified radial should be received. For IFR, the ground check error cannot exceed 4 degrees. Maximum error using the designated airborne check is 6 degrees.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 Another way to check the VOR is the VOT. VOTs transmit the 360 degree radial in all directions. No matter where the aircraft is located, the VOR receiver will indicate the 360 degree radial. Electronically, the aircraft is always located north of the VOT. For IFR flight, the CDI must center within 4 degrees of 360 degrees FROM, or 180 degrees TO.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch4/#global-positioning-system-gps","title":"Global Positioning System (GPS)","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 4 \u2013 Video Segment 13</p> <p>GPS stands for global positioning system.

Air masses are created whenever a large body of air approaches and remains at a source region.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An air mass is created whenever air remains in a region long enough to acquire the temperature and moisture characteristics of the surface.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When conflicting air masses meet, the differences of temperature and moisture are greatest at the ground and at lower altitudes. The weather which results from this conflict is also most intense at lower altitudes and tends to diminish higher up.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The best source regions are large snow and ice covered Polar Regions, cold northern oceans, tropical oceans, and large desert areas.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air masses are identified using three letters. The first lower case letter identifies the surface of the source region, C for continental and M for maritime or a water surface. Source region is indicated by an upper case letter, P for polar, A for arctic, T for tropical and E for equatorial.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last letter is lower case, W for an air mass warmer and K for an air mass colder than the surface over which it is moving.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A W air mass is cooled from below which implies stable conditions with smooth flying, stratus clouds, fog, and poor visibility. Precipitation, if any, would be widespread drizzle and rain.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The K air mass indicates heating air from below and therefore unstable conditions. With unstable conditions pilots can expect rough air to 10,000 feet or so, cumuliform clouds, and if there is precipitation, it is localized or showery.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The zone between contrasting air masses is called a front. All fronts are in troughs which extend from lows.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 Air masses are highs meaning the air pressure within the air mass is higher than the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The lowest pressure in each air mass is found at the boundary between them \u2013 the front.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 The position of a front aloft is just as important as its surface position. A frontal slope can be as steep as 1 to 50 and as shallow as 1 to 300. An airplane 1 mile above the surface could cross the frontal zone in as little as fifty miles from the surface position, or may have to fly as many as 300 miles beyond the surface position of the front.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 When moving across a front, the change of temperature, wind, and humidity may be quite abrupt or very gradual depending on the properties of each air mass. Winds always change direction when you cross a front.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 Air should flow directly from high to low pressure, down the pressure gradient, but air flow is modified by the Coriolis Effect which is caused by the earth's rotation.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 The wind is deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere. Around a low, the flow is counter clockwise or cyclonic. Flow around a high is clockwise or anticyclonic.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 When crossing the front the change in wind direction calls for a heading change to the right in order to maintain course. A heading change to the right is needed when crossing any front in any direction.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 There is a difference in the rate of pressure change across a front. Make sure to keep your altimeter settings current.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 The kind of weather you'll encounter in a front depends on the moisture available, stability of the air that is being lifted, speed of movement, frontal slope, and upper wind flow.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Fronts can be classified as cold, warm, stationary, and occluded.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 When cold air advances and replaces warmer air the leading edge of the cold air is called a cold front. The chart symbol for the cold front is a line with triangles pointing in the direction of movement.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 Cold fronts typically move toward the southeast at speeds of 25 to 30 knots. They frequently produce thunderstorms at the surface position of the front and lines of thunderstorms, called squall lines, a hundred miles or so ahead of the front.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 If warm air is advancing, replacing colder air, the leading edge of the warm air is called a warm front. Warm fronts are charted as half circles on a line pointing in the direction of movement.</p> <p>22.\u00a0 Because warm fronts have a shallower slope, warm frontal weather is usually found over a much wider band than cold front weather.</p> <p>23.\u00a0 If the warm air is unstable there may be thunderstorms embedded in the massive layers of stratus clouds.</p> <p>24.\u00a0 If a front is not moving it's called a stationary front. The cold and warm front symbols are alternated to indicate a stationary front \u2013 pointing in opposite directions.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 Low ceilings, visibilities, and the weather associated with the stationary front may affect an area for several days.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 An occluded front is symbolized by warm and cold front symbols on the same side of the line indicating the direction of movement. It's long lived and can cause violent weather. The warm front moving northward is followed by a cold front which moves faster catching up with the warm front \u2013 pushing air upward which tends to build towering cumulus clouds.</p> <p>27.\u00a0 Weather associated with the occluded front is a combination of warm and cold front weather. The worst weather associated with an occlusion is normally in the northeast portion of the occlusion.</p> <p>28.\u00a0 Occasionally a non frontal low forms just downwind of mountain ranges and can be quite a weather maker. Upslope winds from across the plains can lead to low ceilings and visibilities, drizzle, fog, snow, and ice.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 Be wary of the lee-slopes low. Rapidly changing weather can cause a pleasant clear sky flight to turn into a desperate search for the nearest airport, especially in winter.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 Squall lines are lines of thunderstorms that form along lines of instability. While not directly associated with fronts, squall lines tend to form 50 to 100 miles ahead of and parallel to a cold front. Squall lines are indicated on a weather map by a line drawn with two dots alternating with a long dash.</p> <p>31.\u00a0 Frontal weather can change very rapidly. The cold front which only has cloudiness in the morning may have a strong squall line forecast for the afternoon. The warm front which causes partly cloudy skies in the afternoon may bring fog, drizzle, and low clouds by nightfall.</p> <p>32.\u00a0 To ensure a safe flight, get a good preflight weather briefing.

You should also be able to receive the transmission when on the ground at the ATIS airport.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Listen to the ATIS broadcast prior to arrival or departure from an airport with this system. This will help relieve congestion on approach control, ground control, and local control frequencies. You will simply advise the initial controller the phonetic identification for the broadcast that you listened to.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ATIS information includes the latest METAR, the instrument approach, and the runways in use. Information for arriving VFR aircraft may also be on the ATIS. This could include how far out to contact approach control and the frequency to use.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ATIS is normally updated near the top hour, but can be updated at any time when a significant change in the weather is observed. A new recording is also made for a change in other information such as runway or the instrument approach in use.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pilots are expected to monitor the ATIS broadcast before contacting clearance delivery, ground control, tower, or approach control.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ATIS broadcasts are subject to change at any time. To make the system work, pilots have to tell the controller which ATIS was monitored. This is done on initial contact with any of the tower functions.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may not enter the Class D airspace until you have established radio contact with the controller. This means the controller must acknowledge you with your call sign.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 An initial call to ATC by a student pilot should include the words \"student pilot\" at the end of the transmission. This allows the controller to provide the student with extra assistance. It will also encourage the controller to slow down and have patience with the pilot.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 The \"student pilot\" identification should be added to the initial contact with each subsequent air traffic control station.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 Your entry into the traffic pattern at a tower controlled airport may be on any of the four legs. The tower controller will advise his instructions based upon the runway in use and the direction from which you are approaching.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 At some point, the tower controller will clear you to land.

You may accept the land and hold short clearance provided that you can determine that your aircraft can safely land and stop within the Available Landing Distance.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 Available Landing Distance data is published in the special notices section of the chart supplement and in the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publications.

Read back the instructions and comply with any hold short requirements that you are assigned. Compare the instructions to your taxiway charts and signs that you see after you have completed your read back.</p> <p>27.\u00a0 When taxiing, you must receive a specific runway crossing clearance to cross or operate on any active, inactive, or closed runway along your route.</p> <p>28.\u00a0 When departing from a tower-controlled airport, you should listen to ATIS before making any calls to ATC.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 The ATIS broadcast will provide you with necessary wind and altimeter information. It will also provide you with pertinent NOTAMs that may not have been available during your preflight planning and it will give you an idea on the runway to expect for departure.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 At less busy tower-controlled airports, typical of a Class D airspace airport, your VFR clearance will be obtained from ground control or the tower.</p> <p>31.\u00a0 When ready to taxi onto the movement area of the airport, contact ground control. Advise them where you are located on the airport, what your departure plans are, that you have the appropriate ATIS information, and that you are ready to taxi.</p> <p>32.\u00a0 The ground controller will give taxi instructions to a specific point on the airport and may provide you with a clearance.

When ready for takeoff, switch to the tower frequency and call to advise.</p> <p>35.\u00a0 Don't call the tower at a busy airport until you are number one for takeoff at your location.</p> <p>36.\u00a0 When the tower advises you to \"fly or maintain runway heading,\" this is precisely what the controller means. You are expected to fly or maintain the magnetic heading that corresponds with the extended centerline of the departure runway. Do not apply drift correction in this situation.</p> <p>37.\u00a0 If you need to change frequency to open your flight plan before leaving the tower's airspace, contact the controller with this request. He may or may not ask you to report back to his frequency once your flight service communications are complete.</p> <p>38.\u00a0 During the normal course of your departure, the tower controller may release you from his frequency, but this is not a requirement.

You do this by establishing and maintaining a nose high pitch attitude by use of elevator control as soon as possible during the takeoff roll.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 Set your flaps as recommended by the manufacturer prior to starting the takeoff roll. Once you start to taxi keep moving so you don't get bogged down in the soft surface. When lined up for departure, apply takeoff power.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 As the airplane accelerates, apply enough back elevator pressure to maintain a positive angle of attack and keep the weight off the nose wheel.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 In this attitude the airplane will fly itself off the ground \u2013 lifting off and flying at a slower airspeed than you are accustomed to. This is due to ground effect.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Roughly, ground effect extends up to a height above the ground equal to your airplane's wingspan.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Once flying, and while just above the ground, slowly lower the pitch attitude and let the airplane accelerate to VX if you have to clear obstacles.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 If no obstacles are in the way, accelerate to VY.

Adjust the power and pitch attitude to maintain the manufacturer's recommended approach speed.</p> <p>25.\u00a0 If you are too high, reduce power and lower the pitch to increase the descent without increasing airspeed. If too low, increase power and raise the pitch attitude to slow the rate of descent without lowering airspeed.</p> <p>26.\u00a0 Don't get too slow. Adding full power and increasing pitch may only increase the rate of descent. In this case, you are operating on the back side of the power curve.</p> <p>27.\u00a0 Touchdown in an attitude that will produce a power-off stall when you reduce the power to idle. Hold the elevator control full back, and firmly apply brakes.</p> <p>28.\u00a0 In making a soft-field landing, use flaps as recommended by the airplane's manufacturer. Use the same final approach speed as you did for the short-field landing.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 After the round-out, fly the airplane just above the surface. Do this as long as practical so you can be as slow as possible at touchdown.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 Once down, hold the airplane in a nose high attitude with full back elevator pressure. This is to help keep the nose-wheel clear of the surface while you slow down. You don't want it to dig in.</p> <p>31.\u00a0 Don't use the brakes. In fact, you might have to add power to keep moving and prevent becoming bogged down.</p> <p>32.\u00a0 NOTE: When faced with making a short, soft-field takeoff or landing, don't, except under the most dire emergency situation.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch5/#closer-look-ads-b","title":"Closer Look: ADS-B","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 5 \u2013 Video Segment 9</p> <p>In this section we will take a closer look at ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch5/#review_8","title":"Review:","text":"<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As part of the FAA\u2019s NextGen initiative to modernize ATC, ADS-B will eventually replace radar as the primary tool for separating aircraft.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A-D-S-B is different from radar in that it does not depend on radar sites actively pinging aircraft as they fly.

It is not for unrestricted flight into instrument weather conditions.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In most weather related accidents, pilots lose control of the airplane because of spatial disorientation.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this condition, the tendency is for a pilot to believe more of what he feels than the information from the flight instruments.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are three sensory systems for orientation \u2013 vision, inner ear, and the nerves of the muscles, joints, and skin.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These confusing sensations can be made worse by making sudden head movements, especially when the airplane is turning or pitching.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You must disregard these sensations, and control the airplane by believing the instruments.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flying the airplane on instruments is no different than flying with outside references.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Various combinations of pitch and power result in level, climbing, or descending flight. Coordinated banks result in turns.</p> <p>10.\u00a0 The attitude indicator takes the place of the natural horizon \u2013 the only instrument which provides an instantaneous, direct, visual indication of the airplane's pitch and bank attitude.</p> <p>11.\u00a0 The other flight instruments can only give us an indirect indication of the attitude.</p> <p>12.\u00a0 The control performance method emphasizes the attitude indicator as the control instrument which is used to establish, change, and maintain attitudes. The other instruments are used to check the performance produced by the attitude of the airplane.</p> <p>13.\u00a0 A second method labels instruments as being either primary or supporting. Primary is used to indicate the instrument which gives the most pertinent information and supporting indicates those instruments which confirm that information.</p> <p>14.\u00a0 For example, in level flight, the altimeter is used as the primary instrument for pitch \u2013 airspeed and the vertical speed indicators could be seen as supporting.</p> <p>15.\u00a0 Three skills are involved in all instrument flight. They are scanning the instruments, interpreting the instrument indications, and aircraft control.</p> <p>16.\u00a0 An instrument scan must be developed before you can interpret the instrument indications.</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Some common scanning errors are fixation, omission of an instrument, or too much emphasis on a single instrument.</p> <p>18.\u00a0 Fixation occurs when you stare at one instrument. Omission of an instrument is usually caused by failing to anticipate the result of an attitude change. Eye scan studies show that proficient instrument pilots spend up to three quarters of the time looking at the attitude indicator.</p> <p>19.\u00a0 The components of airplane control are power, pitch, and bank.</p> <p>20.\u00a0 Trim must be used to relieve control pressures.</p> <p>21.\u00a0 The instructor is responsible for watching for other aircraft.

When correcting for a heading deviation, use coordinated aileron and rudder.</p> <p>29.\u00a0 In straight-and-level flight, the vertical speed indicator should remain in the zero position. The airspeed indicator should show normal cruise speed. The turn coordinator or turn needle should be centered with the ball centered, showing coordinated flight.</p> <p>30.\u00a0 Climbs and descents on instruments are to be made straight at constant airspeed. The pitch attitude for climbs and descents can be determined by checking the attitude indicator when making climbs and descents using outside references.</p> <p>31.\u00a0 To enter a climb straight ahead, raise the nose of the miniature airplane to the approximate climb attitude while increasing to climb power. As the airspeed slows add nose up trim. Use right rudder to compensate for the left turning tendency.</p> <p>32.\u00a0 With a constant power setting, airspeed changes can only be made by changing pitch. If a pitch change is necessary, use the attitude indicator and make small adjustments. Don't expect the airspeed to change quickly.</p> <p>33.\u00a0 As the pitch change is made, the vertical speed indicator will show the trend by moving upward but will not show the actual rate of climb until several seconds after the climb stabilizes.</p> <p>34.\u00a0 Use the heading indicator as the instrument for straight flight.</p> <p>35.\u00a0 When the climb is stabilized, use the trim to relieve control pressure.</p> <p>36.\u00a0 As a rule of thumb, a level off from both climbs and descents should be started approximately 10 percent of the rate of climb or descent prior to reaching the assigned</p> <p>altitude. For example, at 500 feet per minute, start your level off 50 feet before the desired altitude.</p> <p>37.\u00a0 As airspeed reaches cruise, reduce power to cruise power setting and make the final trim adjustment.</p> <p>38.\u00a0 To enter a straight descent, first reduce power to the desired setting, and apply back pressure to maintain altitude.</p> <p>39.\u00a0 To correct airspeed, make small pitch changes, using the attitude indicator to make the changes. When the airspeed is stabilized make the final trim adjustment.</p> <p>40.\u00a0 Keep the wings level using the attitude indicator, and use the heading indicator to check for and correct deviations from the desired heading.</p> <p>41.\u00a0 Turns by reference to the instruments should be limited to no more than standard rate. Turns of less than 30 degrees should be made at half standard rate.</p> <p>42.\u00a0 Using coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, establish the desired bank on the attitude indicator. Use the banking scale on the top of the instrument.</p> <p>43.\u00a0 At relatively shallow bank angles, very little back pressure is needed to maintain altitude.</p> <p>44.\u00a0 If you are losing altitude, shallow the bank rather than adding a lot of back pressure. Check, but don't fixate, on the heading indicator.</p> <p>45.\u00a0 To roll out, assuming a 15 degree bank, start the roll out about 8 degrees before reaching the new heading. Less bank will require less lead.</p> <p>46.\u00a0 You'll be asked to close your eyes and take your hands and feet from the controls. The instructor will then put the airplane in either a diving spiral or a nose high attitude approaching a stall. You'll then be told to open your eyes take the controls and return the airplane to straight-and-level flight.</p> <p>47.\u00a0 The attitude indicator will give you an instantaneous direct indication of the pitch and bank attitude.</p> <p>48.\u00a0 Pitch attitude can be indirectly determined by the airspeed indicator, the vertical speed indicator, and the altimeter. The bank can be indirectly determined by the heading and turn indicators.</p> <p>49.\u00a0 If the nose is high with the airspeed decreasing, use the same recovery technique used in the approach to the stall, add power to prevent altitude loss, lower the pitch attitude to the level flight position and level the wings.</p> <p>50.\u00a0 The other possible unusual attitude is when the pitch attitude is below level flight, and airspeed is increasing. Reduce power to prevent excessive airspeed, level the wings, and then raise the nose to the level flight attitude.</p> <p>51.\u00a0 Using radio aids to navigation, while controlling the airplane by reference to the instruments, adds to your workload both physically and mentally.</p> <p>52.\u00a0 Your first concern is to fly the airplane.

Whether you\u2019re flying VFR or IFR, it\u2019s always smart to begin with a look at the major weather systems.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where are the highs and lows, the cold fronts and warm fronts? Where are these systems forecast to move? Use the Prog Charts product to answer these questions, and get an overview of major weather trends.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 Hr Qty of Precipitation and 12 hour Prob of Precipitation (or PoP) are oddly-named charts, but they\u2019re really valuable. That\u2019s because, while moisture or precipitation doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to bad weather, there\u2019s often a correlation.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the winter, areas of precipitation often mean icing aloft; in the fall it might mean IFR conditions. Get a general sense of where the moisture is and where it\u2019s moving (or not as the case may be).</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other benefit of these precipitation forecasts is that they stretch out far into the future. Whereas TAFs are fairly near term forecasts, the PoP forecast goes out to 7 days. That\u2019s valuable if you\u2019re planning the return leg of an out and back trip. Use it to get a general sense of the long term weather trends.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final piece of the \u201cbig picture\u201d briefing is a look at convective hazards, which you can find in the last three maps in the first section (CONUS weather).</p> <ol> <li> <p>Convective hazards can be added to your knowledge of the precipitation areas to determine whether that precip is just rain or perhaps something a lot more serious.</p> </li> <li> <p>With that background in mind, the graphical aviation forecasts will make a lot more sense. You\u2019ll find two different types of charts here \u2013 cloud and surface forecasts. Both rely on computer models to generate the data shown on the charts.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Cloud forecast maps graphically depict cloud coverage across the U.S. and includes AIRMETs for ice and mountain obscurations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The surface chart forecasts visibility, surface winds, precipitation and other weather hazards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next it\u2019s time to consider the full three dimensions of the atmosphere. Specifically, ForeFlight offers forecasts for three conditions at altitude \u2013 winds, icing and turbulence.</p> </li> <li> <p>The winds aloft forecast maps are helpful for choosing the fastest cruise altitude, but they are also valuable for understanding how the highs and lows are moving.</p> </li> <li> <p>For instrument pilots, the icing forecasts are essential maps. You can get a detailed look at potential in-flight icing risks, by both altitude and time.</p> </li> <li> <p>The legends on the icing forecasts explain the colors well, but make sure you know whether the chart you\u2019re viewing forecasts the probability of icing (that is, how likely it is that icing conditions exist) or the severity of icing (whether any ice will be light, moderate or severe). You could be flying in an area where the probability is high but the severity is low - or vice versa.</p> </li> <li> <p>Comparing different altitudes will tell you which altitudes might be above or below any potential icing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The turbulence charts can help you find a smooth ride. Like the winds aloft, they are divided into low-level, mid-level, and high-level sections, with each section showing specific altitudes and forecasts out to 18 hours.</p> </li> <li> <p>The turbulence charts are further divided by the cause of turbulence: clear air or mountain wave.</p> </li> <li> <p>Like the icing forecasts, the turbulence maps are model-driven, so back them up with actual Pilot Reports.</p> </li> <li> <p>All three of the upper level products - winds, turbulence, and icing - make it easy to plan not only your route, but the right altitude.</p> </li> <li> <p>So far we\u2019ve dealt with mostly forecasts \u2013 that is, predictions about what might happen. These are helpful, especially if your flight isn\u2019t for a few days.</p> </li> <li> <p>As you get closer to your time of departure, you need more real-time, more regional information \u2013 observations instead of forecasts. The three main observations in ForeFlight are satellite, radar and PIREPs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remember that, that satellite, radar, and PIREPs can be overlaid on the Maps page.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch5/#self-serve-fuel","title":"Self-Serve Fuel","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 5 \u2013 Video Segment 22</p> <p>Many airports offer a self-serve fuel option at a cheaper price per gallon, which can offer big savings for large fill-ups and serve as a plan B for fuel when landing after hours when the FBO is closed.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch5/#review_21","title":"Review:","text":"<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, identify the location of the fuel pump at the airport.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Park close to the pump, but not too close.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After shutdown, remove the keys from the ignition and verify the master switch is off.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All fuel pumps will have a grounding wire at the pump that has to be connected to the aircraft.</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swipe your credit card first and enter either how many gallons or dollars and fuel type you need.</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most pumps require you to activate the pump with a lever or switch before fuel will flow.</p> <p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fuel pumps for aircraft do not have an auto-shutoff so fill the tanks with caution to avoid over-fueling and spillage.</p> <p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the tank is fueled, immediately replace the cap.</p> <p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turn off the pump with the switch or lever, and retract the fuel hose when finished.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make sure to leave the self-serve fuel pump the same as you found it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Take a walk around the airplane to verify the fuel caps are on, the area is cleaned up, and your aircraft is ready to fly.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch6/","title":"Chapter 6 \u2013 Your Private Pilot Test","text":""},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch6/#rules-to-fly-by","title":"Rules to Fly By","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 6 \u2013 Video Segment 1</p> <p>In this section we will discuss the FAA regulations that apply to you as the holder of a private pilot certificate.</p>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch6/#review","title":"Review:","text":"<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the FAA regulations are logical and provide a framework for good operating practices.</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pilot in command is directly responsible for, and the final authority as to, the operation of the aircraft.

You will be less likely to forget. Downwind is a good place, as is three miles out on a straight in approach or base leg entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>One thing you'll notice when you move up to faster airplanes is an increased requirement to trim. A rudder trim system might also be included.</p> </li> <li> <p>You do have to step up your rate of thinking and acting when flying a faster airplane, requiring you to plan descents more carefully. A GPS and its VNAV function can be a big help here.</p> </li> <li> <p>High-performance airplanes with larger engines are more susceptible to shock cooling, compared to those found in training airplanes. Factor the power settings into your descent planning, and reduce the power by only one or two inches of manifold pressure per minute, to allow the engine temperatures to come down slowly as you approach the airport traffic pattern.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"aviation/notes/ch6/#cessna-182-skylane","title":"Cessna 182 Skylane","text":"<p>Private Pilot Chapter 6 \u2013 Video Segment 14</p> <p>Once you acquire your private pilot certificate, you might want to step up to something with more performance than your trainers.

Therefore, he calculated the work on one treefrog to 0.8 USD for MK3s/MINI and 1.6 USD for SL1. It\u2019s not too expensive to prepare small models downloaded from the internet. However, it\u2019s important to know that plenty of models require more difficult print preparations. Even slicing alone can take even 30 minutes or more \u2013 e.g. preparing supports for SLA printing using manual supports can take a long time.</p> <p>The price for human labor can, in many cases, reach dozens of USD, especially in cases when something completely new has to be designed.

He started with electricity: according to the local electricity distributor\u2019s rates, 1 kWh costs from 0.07 USD to 0.09 USD. Let\u2019s work with 0.09 USD. The printer input power depends on several factors, however, most of the time it needs around 100-150 W. Printing a tree frog on the MK3s takes 1h 16 min, 1h 10min on the MINI,\u00a0and 1h 48 min on the SL1. With 150W power input (usually it\u2019s not that much), electricity for printing one tree frog will be less than 0,023 USD. Such a low price is practically negligible.</p> <p>On the other hand, Josef would like to recoup the money he spent on buying his printers within 6 months (4392 hours) of printing. This led him to add a fixed fee to printing hour costs.

There are other factors coming into play as well: for example, a printing accident could occur, causing the loss of filament. Or there may be extra maintenance costs. The most common issues are usually print quality problems (e.g. printing large ASA-based objects can lead to warping etc.). You can head over to our older articles about print quality and troubleshooting.</p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s not easy to calculate a price that would cover all potential issues and/or mistakes. It largely depends on the user\u2019s experience and many other factors. In this case, Josef has to observe what percentage of prints tend to fail over a long period, and what do these failures cost him. However, for starters, he set the margin to be 30% of the material (filament or resin) price.</p> <p>So, let\u2019s sum up the order: Josef charged the customer the following prices: 1.3 USD (MK3s), 1.16 USD (MINI), and 3.15 USD (SL1), tax not included. Certainly, there will be many people who see it differently \u2013 there are customers who won\u2019t pay larger sums of money and there are makers who don\u2019t see it profitable enough.</p> <p>The purpose of this guide is to give you an overview of all things you should take into account when calculating the costs. Basically, you need to include the material costs, time spent on print preparations, and some kind of \u201cfailure insurance\u201d, plus general running costs. The price for energy consumed is almost negligible. Really long prints will be around a dollar, tops. Obviously, we did not include taxes \u2013 if you want to start a business with commissioned 3D printing, you need to check your country\u2019s laws regarding this kind of work.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a complete recap of Josef\u2019s order: Material: 0.15 (MK3s) + 0.15 (MINI) + 0.6 (SL1) USD Labor: 0.8 (MK3s) + 0.8 (MINI) + 1.6 (SL1) USD Printer operation: 0.27 (MK3s) + 0.12 (MINI) + 0.65 (SL1) USD Margin (30% of material cost): 0.05 (MK3s) + 0.05 (MINI) + 0.18 (SL1) USD Total: 5.42 USD</p> <p>Finally, let\u2019s see how the price would change if the customer wanted to have a truly large and complex model printed on the MK3s. Again, it\u2019s a downloaded model, which is pretty much ready to print, however, it takes 1 day, 17 hours, and 48 minutes to finish. The material of choice is a non-standard carbon fiber composite material XT-CF20, which costs 49.99 USD and we will need 756 g to finish the print. Other values necessary for the calculation remain the same:</p> <p>Material: (49.99 / 750) * 756 = 50.39 USD Labor: 0.8 USD Printer operation: 0.21 * 41.8 + 0.023 * 41.8 = 9.74 USD Margin (30% of material cost): 50,39 * 0,3 = 15,12 USD Total: 76.05 USD</p> <p>It comes as no surprise that larger objects and expensive materials also mean much higher final prices, even though the price for labor stays the same. Printer running/maintenance costs gradually increase with printed hours.

So far I\u2019ve only printed with a 0.2mm layer height, but it supports down to 0.1mm. The objects I\u2019ve produced, whilst obviously 3D printed, are of good detail and finish and are very strong.

It simply cannot achieve the required detail that SLA printers relish in. Unfortunately, resin printers are expensive. Even with the D7 and possible MP clone, it can get pretty expensive. Not to mention the amount of post processing. In this post, I intend to equip you with the tools to print your minis on your regular cheap FDM printer.</p> <p>This post is thanks to the great feedback received on my previous post. For those of you who just wanted my Cura settings, enjoy!</p> <ul> <li>Proper layer heights</li> </ul> <p>You may think that a lower layer height is always better. 0.05 must be better than 0.08, right? The problem with this is that stepper motors move in steps. These motors moving in parts of a step can be a big problem over time. Less accurate layers will result in big layer lines and weaker layers.</p> <p>To solve this, find out what your stepper motor is geared to. There are plenty of guides on this already that would dwarf the size of this post. The Monoprice Maker Select, for example, has a step of 0.04mm. This means that 0.08mm would look much better than 0.10mm.</p> <ul> <li>Top Layers</li> </ul> <p>Printing at such low layer heights require a lot of top layers. For normal layer heights, 5 top layers is more than enough. At such low layer heights, you need many more. here is what 5 and 10 layers looks like. 5 layers is only 0.2mm high, while 10 was 0.4mm tall. With a more dense infill and better cooling, this would probably be sufficient. I would suggest 0.5mm thick top layers as a minimum. This only had a big impact on the stand of the model, the rest of the mini printed fine.</p> <ul> <li>Cooling / Temperature</li> </ul> <p>Cooling is of the utmost importance when it comes to detailed minis. You want to have enough cooling to be able to lay the filament in thin air; because that's what you are doing for a lot of the model. This means you need even cooling all around your nozzle. A dii cooler is ideal for this. Also be sure to run some Temperature tests for each roll of filament.</p> <p>Also be sure to not have a minimum layer time. This may increase the cooling, but doing that results in big blobs wherever the layer starts. The extra filament on the end could also harden quickly and may end up knocking your mini over. If you want to have a longer lay time, either print slower or print 2 at a time. Printing multiples often increases the details on those really tiny minis. Especially the kobold. I print them 4-5 at a time!</p> <ul> <li>Speed</li> </ul> <p>Slow. Print very slow. I would print at 30-40% of your normal speed for minis. I generally print 45-60mm/s, so for minis I print 20-25mm/s. This gives more time per layer for cooling, which is the ultimate goal here.</p> <ul> <li>Supports</li> </ul> <p>Don't use slicer made supports. They are either difficult to remove or useless in my experience. S3D may have better options than Cura, but they still use a similar concept. Build straight up from the next point down. This hurts arms and legs. The supports often fully enclose the legs and the upper arms making them very difficult to remove without breaking off some limbs.</p> <p>Instead I use Meshmixer. Not only can you clean up your models, but the supports look beautiful. The settings may take a while to set in, but here are my settings. It is important to not have a tip diameter larger than your nozzle size. That would result in the tips not fully printing and being too far from the mini. If you have really good cooling, you can use a higher angle threshhold. If you find supports aren't being placed where you need them, you can either place them yourself or adjust the tip height. 80 density works well for me, but many models could be printed in 50. I prefer to keep the optimization low. here is 0 whereas here is 100. Both print fine, there is no difference in quality. It technically uses less filament, but you spend just as much printing the skirt of a print. The main difference is that the 100 took 5 minutes to prune.</p> <ul> <li>Retraction</li> </ul> <p>There isn't much to say in this part. You need to make sure your retraction is damn perfect for many of these models. Especially if you are using meshmixer supports. Do a bunch of pillar tests to determine the optimal retraction settings. I use 3mm at 25mm/s on my MMS with Hatchbox PLA. It is a good starting point for most direct drive extruders. Bowden tubes may be more difficult.</p> <ul> <li>Conclusion</li> </ul> <p>Minis are hard to print in FDM. Just plain hard. Of course you can do it, but resin is better. If that is your intention with 3D printing, resin 100% of the time. But for people who already have an FDM printer or want a cheaper printer, this guide should be helpful enough to get started</p> <p>If I didn't address anything, or I missed something, don't hesitate to ask.

When your button is pressed, 5 volts will freely flow through your circuit, and when it is not pressed, the input pin will be connected to ground through the 10k ohm resistor.

With the release of Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8, they introduced a new command-line interface \u2013 apt.</p> <p>The main goal for this novelty was to merge the most commonly used <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt-cache</code> commands under the same command prefix.</p> <p>Note: The <code>apt</code> command is more user-friendly compared to the existing APT tools.

Server Provides resources to network users, including email, web pages, or files. Hub A Layer 1 device that does not perform any inspection of traffic. A hub simply receives traffic in a port and repeats that traffic out of all the other ports. Switch A Layer 2 device that makes its forwarding decisions based on the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address. A switch learns which devices reside off which ports by examining the source MAC address. The switch then forwards traffic only to the appropriate port, and not to all the other ports. Router A Layer 3 device that makes forwarding decisions based on Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. Based on the routing table, the router intelligently forwards the traffic out of the appropriate interface. Multilayer switch Can operate at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Also called a Layer 3 switch, a multilayer switch is a high-performance device that can switch traffic within the LAN and for- ward packets between subnets. Media Media can be copper cabling, fiber-optic cabling, or radio waves. Media varies in its cost, bandwidth capacity, and distance limitation. Analog modem Modem is short for modulator/demodulator. An analog modem converts the digital signals generated by a computer into analog signals that can travel over conventional phone lines. Broadband modem A digital modem used with high-speed DSL or cable Internet service. Both operate in a similar manner to the analog modem, but use higher broadband frequencies and transmission speeds.

It is a computer network that connects a findnumber of LANs to form a larger network so that the computer resources can be shared. <p>IEEE Standards:</p> Standards Description IEEE 802 LAN/MAN IEEE 802.1 LAN/MAN Bridging and management IEEE 802.1s Multiple spanning tree IEEE 802.1w Rapid reconfiguration of spanning tree IEEE 802.1x Port-based network access control IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD access method (Ethernet) IEEE 802.3ae 10 Gigabit Ethernet IEEE 802.4 Token passing bus access method and Physical layer specifications IEEE 802.5 Token Ring access method and Physical layer specifications IEEE 802.6 Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) access method and Physical layer specifications (MAN) IEEE 802.7 Broadband LAN IEEE 802.8 Fiber Optic IEEE 802.9 Isochronous LANs (standard withdrawn) IEEE 802.10 Interoperable LAN/MAN Security IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN MAC and Physical layer specifications IEEE 802.11a Wireless with speed up to 54 Mbps IEEE 802.11b Wireless with speed up to 11 Mbps IEEE 802.11g Wireless with speed up to 54 Mbps IEEE 802.11n Wireless with speed up to 600 Mbps IEEE 802.12 Demand-priority access method, physical layer, and repeater specifications IEEE 802.13 Not used IEEE 802.14 Cable modems (proposed standard was withdrawn) IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) IEEE 802.16 Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (Wireless MAN) IEEE 802.17 Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) Access <p>Networking Devices:</p> Device Description Client Any device, such as a workstation, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, that is used to access a network. Server Provides resources to network users, including email, web pages, or files. Hub A Layer 1 device that does not perform any inspection of traffic. A hub simply receives traffic in a port and repeats that traffic out of all the other ports. Switch A Layer 2 device that makes its forwarding decisions based on the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address. A switch learns which devices reside off which ports by examining the source MAC address. The switch then forwards traffic only to the appropriate port, and not to all the other ports. Router A Layer 3 device that makes forwarding decisions based on Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. Based on the routing table, the router intelligently forwards the traffic out of the appropriate interface. Multilayer switch Can operate at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Also called a Layer 3 switch, a multilayer switch is a high-performance device that can switch traffic within the LAN and forward packets between subnets. Media Media can be copper cabling, fiber-optic cabling, or radio waves. Media varies in its cost, bandwidth capacity, and distance limitation. Analog modem Modem is short for modulator/demodulator. An analog modem converts the digital signals generated by a computer into analog signals that can travel over conventional phone lines. Broadband modem A digital modem used with high-speed DSL or cable Internet service. Both operate in a similar manner to the analog modem but use higher broadband frequencies and transmission speeds. Access point (AP) A network device with a built-in antenna, transmitter, and adapter that provides a connection point between WLANs and a wired Ethernet LAN. APs usually have several wired RJ-45 ports to support LAN clients. Most small office or home office (SOHO) routers integrate an AP. <p>Cables in Networking Devices:</p> Ethernet Standards Data Rate Cable Fiber Type Maximum Distance (IEEE) Ethernet (10Base-FL) 10 Mbps 50m or 62.5um Multimode @ 850nm 2km Fast Ethernet (100Base-FX) 100 Mbps 50m or 62.5um Multimode @ 1300nm 2km Fast Ethernet (100Base-SX) 100 Mbps 50m or 62.5um Multimode @ 850nm 300m Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-SX) 1000 Mbps 50m Multimode @ 850nm 550m Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-SX) 1000 Mbps 62.5um Multimode @ 850nm 220m Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-LX) 1000 Mbps 50m or 62.5um Multimode @ 1300nm 550m Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-LX) 1000 Mbps 9um Singlemode @1310nm 5km Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-LH) 1000 Mbps 9um Singlemode @1550nm 70km <p>Types of Ethernet Networks:</p> Speed Common Name Informal IEEE Standard Name Formal IEEE Standard Name Cable Type, Maximum Length 10 Mbps Ethernet 10BASE-T 802.3 Copper, 100 m 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet 100BASE-T 802.3u Copper, 100 m 1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-LX 802.3z Fiber, 5000 m 1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-T 802.3ab Copper, 100 m 10 Gbps 10 Gig Ethernet 10GBASE-T 802.3an Copper, 100 m","tags":["Networking"]},{"location":"tech/network/resources/#more-resources","title":"More Resources:","text":"","tags":["Networking"]},{"location":"tech/network/resources/#forums","title":"Forums","text":"<ul> <li>Linux Tech Tips</li> <li>Lawrence Systems Forums</li> </ul>","tags":["Networking"]},{"location":"tech/network/resources/#router-options","title":"Router Options","text":"<ul> <li>VP2420 - 4x 2.5G Port Intel \u00ae Celeron J6412 - Protectli</li> </ul>","tags":["Networking"]},{"location":"tech/network/speedtest/","title":"Speedtest","text":"","tags":["#Networking","Speedtest"]},{"location":"tech/network/speedtest/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Releases \u00b7 asheroto/speedtest</li> </ul>","tags":["#Networking","Speedtest"]},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/","title":"Network Topologies","text":""},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/#bus-topology","title":"Bus Topology","text":"<p>This creates a simple network topology with an Internet connection, a firewall, a switch, and three computers. <pre><code>graph TD\n  A[Device 1] --&gt;|Bus| B[Device 2]\n  B --&gt;|Bus| C[Device 3]\n  C --&gt;|Bus| D[Device 4]\n  D --&gt;|Bus| E[Device 5]</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/#ring-topology","title":"Ring Topology","text":"<p>This represents a ring topology where each computer is connected to exactly two other computers forming a closed loop. <pre><code>graph TD\n  A[Device 1] --&gt;|Ring| B[Device 2]\n  B --&gt;|Ring| C[Device 3]\n  C --&gt;|Ring| D[Device 4]\n  D --&gt;|Ring| E[Device 5]\n  E --&gt;|Ring| A\n\n ```\n\n## Star Topology\nThis represents a star topology where all computers are connected to a central switch.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Device 1] --&gt;|Switch| S[Central Switch]\n  B[Device 2] --&gt;|Switch| S\n  C[Device 3] --&gt;|Switch| S\n  D[Device 4] --&gt;|Switch| S\n  E[Device 5] --&gt;|Switch| S\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/#mesh","title":"Mesh","text":"<pre><code>graph TD\n  A[Device 1] --&gt;|Mesh| B[Device 2]\n  A --&gt;|Mesh| C[Device 3]\n  A --&gt;|Mesh| D[Device 4]\n  B --&gt;|Mesh| C\n  B --&gt;|Mesh| D\n  C --&gt;|Mesh| D</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/#tree","title":"Tree","text":"<pre><code>graph TD\n  A[Hub 1] --&gt;|Bus| B[Device 1.1]\n  A --&gt;|Bus| C[Device 1.2]\n  A --&gt;|Bus| D[Device 1.3]\n  B --&gt;|Bus| E[Device 1.1.1]\n  B --&gt;|Bus| F[Device 1.1.2]\n  C --&gt;|Bus| G[Device 1.2.1]\n  C --&gt;|Bus| H[Device 1.2.2]\n  D --&gt;|Bus| I[Device 1.3.1]\n  D --&gt;|Bus| J[Device 1.3.2]</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/network/topologies/#hybrid","title":"Hybrid","text":"<pre><code>graph TD\n  A[Device 1] --&gt;|Bus| B[Device 2]\n  A --&gt;|Mesh| C[Device 3]\n  A --&gt;|Star| D[Device 4]\n  B --&gt;|Ring| E[Device 5]\n  C --&gt;|Tree| F[Device 6.1]\n  C --&gt;|Tree| G[Device 6.2]\n  D --&gt;|Bus| H[Device 7]</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/network/ufw_firewall/","title":"Set Up UFW Firewall","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Hey, this isn't my work.

You can place the public key on any server, and then connect to the server using an SSH client that has access to the private key.</p> <p>When the public and private keys match up, the SSH server grants access without the need for a password.

One aspect in antenna selection is knowing the intended test frequencies and then selecting a matching antenna.  </p> <p>Not all antennas are created equal, and when it comes to frequency different antenna styles perform better at some frequencies and not at others. Some special considerations are sometimes required in antenna design typically at very high and very low frequencies. Take an antenna for a low frequency in the kHz range. A single wavelength at this range is on the order of miles long. Even a \u00bc wavelength antenna at kHz frequencies is impractical at around 10,000 ft long. To get a better understanding of wavelength size and frequency, this calculator is helpful.  </p> <p>Low frequency radio signals tend to act more like low frequency audio, traveling through and around objects in non-directional ways. On the other hand, elements for high frequency antennas on the order of GHz can be very small, but signals tend to propagate in very directional ways more like light, but also won\u2019t go around or through objects. Because of this, low frequency signals are naturally more omnidirectional and high frequency ones are more directional. Attempting to make directional low frequency antennas or omnidirectional high frequency ones can be challenging.  </p> <p>Other antenna design factors such as bandwidth are frequency-dependent as well. High frequencies require more precise length elements, making it more difficult to construct a wide bandwidth high  frequency antenna, but some designs manage to achieve this.</p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#active-and-passive","title":"Active and passive","text":"<p>Receiving and transmitting RF signals, while related, have some different antenna requirements. Reception picks  up very small signals and delivers them to the receiver, requiring a well-tuned sensitive antenna. To aid with weak signals, some antennas or receivers employ active circuitry that amplifies the incoming signal. The amplifiers are  better located near to or on the antenna to reduce the chance of it amplifying the noise as well, but ideally will boost weak signals. When used with a transceiver, these amplifiers need to be switched in and out since they do not handle transmit power. They are designed so they are connected during reception, but bypassed during transmission. </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#beam-width-and-antenna-gain","title":"Beam width and antenna gain","text":"<p>Another factor in antenna selection is beam width, or the gain of the signal versus how directional it is. Directional antennas have a narrow beam width in the shape of a lobe in the intended direction, while omnidirectional antennas  have a more spherical propagation. Other antennas \u2014 such as doughnut-shaped ones \u2014 have some directionality. In this case, the signal does not propagate up or down much but does cover 360\u00b0 on a single plane. Calculators such as this one can be helpful for determining beam width requirements.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#frequency-range","title":"Frequency range","text":"<p>Antennas have different frequencies they are tuned for, in addition to the bandwidth or range or frequencies they can cover. Horn antennas and similar designs have a relatively narrow bandwidth while others such as a log periodic in comparison are very wide. Choosing an antenna with a wider bandwidth will also impact its other characteristics. If only a narrow test frequency is needed, it is preferable to have an antenna designed solely for  that range.</p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#loop-antennas","title":"Loop antennas","text":"<p>For low frequencies below 30 MHz, loop antennas are ideal for magnetic field strength measurements. These consist of a typically circular loop or coil; the size and number of turns of the loop impacts the frequency the antenna works on. Without any matching network, loop antennas are resonant such that the circumference is a single wavelength of the desired frequency. They can be adjusted with a matching network to be anywhere from 10% of the size up to full size wavelength. Loop antennas are convenient to use due to their small size relative to their frequency. For magnetic field testing at low frequencies, loop antennas produce a voltage for a given field strength, making them easy to use. They are less idea for higher frequencies due to their  size and response characteristics.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#monopoles","title":"Monopoles","text":"<p>Monopoles can be used in many frequency ranges depending on their size, but like other antennas get larger at lower frequencies. Matching networks used with monopoles allow them to work over a wider range. Monopoles are constructed of a ground plane that is typically around \u00bc wavelength and a single  radiating/reception element in the middle of the ground plane and perpendicular to it. Monopoles are good for measuring the electric field in testing.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#log-periodic-and-hybrid-antennas","title":"Log periodic and hybrid antennas","text":"<p>The log periodic antenna is another broadband antenna that is much more directional and handles higher frequencies than other similar designs. They are constructed of multiple elements that become progressively smaller toward the tip of the antenna.  These antennas are a good choice for both emission and immunity testing and can be used for both reception and transmission.  </p> <p>The hybrid or biological antenna design is a mix of a log periodic and a bow tie type design as a reflector. This antenna design has a wideband response, making it a good choice for testing a wide range of frequencies without having to switch antennas. It can be used for immunity and other compliance testing with repeatable results.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#dipoles","title":"Dipoles","text":"<p>The dipole is a simple design and is considered somewhat of a standard when it comes to antennas. Its design consists of two equal length of tuned elements in line with each other but opposite in direction. The elements on a dipole are typically tuned to \u00bc wavelength such that the total length is \u00bd wavelength. The dipole is simple but also an effective antenna with a radiation pattern that covers a 360\u00b0 doughnut-like pattern when vertically polarized. When horizontally polarized, the same doughnut pattern makes them bi-directional. Shorter dipoles can also be constructed with matching network components. The dipole does not have a very wide bandwidth and while still useful it is less desirable for testing a wide range of frequencies as it requires adjustments or multiple antennas for different test frequencies.</p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#biconical-antennas","title":"Biconical antennas","text":"<p>Biconical antennas are a modified type of dipole where the two elements form a roughly conical shape. This change allows them to have a wider bandwidth versus a regular dipole. The cones used on these are rarely solid and are often made of multiple elements, making them easier to fold or transport. Their broadband nature allows quick testing without having to adjust or change the antenna. They are linearly polarized and typically work in  frequency from 20 MHz to 300 MHz, but when designed for it, they can work as high as 18 GHz.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#horns","title":"Horns","text":"<p>At frequencies around 1 GHz and higher, a horn antenna becomes a practical choice. Horns are too large for sub-1 GHz use but they work well for high frequencies. Horn antennas are very directional both for receiving and transmitting so they can both pick up weak signals and transmit a strong signal to a device. This makes them a good choice for both immunity and emission testing.  </p> <p>Above 1 GHz a horn is still a good choice and they get physically smaller and more directional as frequency increases. Horns work well up to 40 GHz and above, but the addition of a pre-amplifier for reception is a good addition to improve the dynamic range of the antenna.  </p>","tags":["radio","antenna"]},{"location":"tech/radio/antenna_selection/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Selecting the right antenna for a situation can sometimes seem confusing when considering all the necessary criteria.

CTCSS and DCS \u201cprivacy tones or codes\u201d (which don\u2019t actually provide privacy) are allowed on MURS. </p> <p>What are the differences between MURS and\u00a0GMRS radios?</p> <ol> <li>MURS radios are totally license-free to operate, while GMRS radios require an FCC license.  </li> <li>MURS radios are less crowded.  </li> <li>MURS radios are with fixed 2 Watts output. GMRS radios are capable of up to 50 Watts power output, which means a longer range communication possibility.  </li> <li>MURS radios aren't able to hit repeaters for extending range, while some GMRS radios do.  </li> <li>MURS radios don't work with FRS radios, while GMRS radios do.  </li> <li>MURS radios are with fewer channels. </li> </ol> <p>What are the differences between MURS and FRS radios?</p> <ol> <li>MURS radios are less crowded.  </li> <li>MURS radios are allowed to use removable antennas, while FRS radios aren't.  </li> <li>MURS radios transmit on the VHF band, which provides better coverage in rural and outdoor areas. FRS works better in urban environments.  </li> <li>MURS radios don't work with GMRS radios, while FRS radios do.  </li> <li>MURS radios are with fewer channels. Handheld FRS units may have up to 22 channels. </li> </ol>","tags":["gmrs","radio","ham","MURS"]},{"location":"tech/raspi/","title":"Raspberry Pi","text":"<p>The little computer that could!
