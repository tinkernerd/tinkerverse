to Fly By<a class=headerlink href=#rules-to-fly-by title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 1</em></p> <p>In this section we will discuss the FAA regulations that apply to you as the holder of a private pilot certificate.</p> <h3 id=review>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Most of the FAA regulations are logical and provide a framework for good operating practices.</p> <p>2.    The pilot in command is directly responsible for, and the final authority as to, the operation of the aircraft. This comes with the accompanying responsibility for safe and legal operation.</p> <p>3.    The pilot in command may, in an emergency, deviate from any rule or clearance to the extent required to meet that emergency. A written report may be required.</p> <p>4.    Your pilot certificate has no expiration date. However, to fly legally you must have a current medical certificate appropriate to the kind of flying you will be doing.</p> <p>5.    Personal and business flying requires a third class medical and a private certificate. To fly for hire, you need a second class medical, and a commercial certificate. Air transport operations require an ATP and a first class medical certificate.</p> <p>6.    A third class medical is good for 60 calendar months if you're less than 40 years old. Over 40, it's good for 24 calendar months.</p> <p>7.    A second class is good for 12 calendar months except where the pilot needs only a third class for the type flying he'll be doing.</p> <p>8.    A first class is good for six calendar months for air transport operations and reverts to second class privileges for commercial flying and to third class privileges for personal and business flying.</p> <p>9.    All pilots must complete a flight review. A flight review is good for 24 calendar months, or until the end of the month, year after next.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Part of the flight review goes over the current general operating rules of FAR Part 91. The other part reviews proficiency in an aircraft for which the pilot is rated. You will have a minimum of one hour each of flight and ground instruction.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are some exceptions to this rule.</p> </li> <li> <p>The aeronautical training and experience used to meet the requirements for a certificate or rating, or the recent flight experience requirements of Part 61, must be shown in your logbook. The logging of other flight time is not required.</p> </li> <li> <p>You log as solo only the time you are in the airplane alone. Pilot in command time is that flight time during which you are the sole manipulator of the controls of an airplane for which you are rated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pilot in command time is also when you are the sole occupant of an aircraft for which you are rated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instrument flight is only that time during which you operate the airplane solely by reference to instruments, under actual or simulated conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Entries must include the place and type of each instrument approach completed, and the name of the safety pilot for each simulated instrument flight.</p> </li> <li> <p>You'll use the time you logged to verify recent experience requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can't act as pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers unless within the preceding 90 days you have made three takeoffs and three landings as the sole manipulator of the flight controls in an airplane of the same class. This would be to a full stop in a tail wheel airplane.</p> </li> <li> <p>At night, you can't act as pilot in command of an airplane carrying passengers unless, within the preceding 90 days, you have made three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop at night in the category and class aircraft to be used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Night for this currency is defined as the period beginning one hour after sunset and ending one hour before sunrise.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you change your permanent mailing address, you must notify the FAA Airman Certification Branch within 30 days to keep your certificate valid.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you fly, you must have your pilot and medical certificates plus a photo ID in your possession or readily available in the aircraft.

It may even be the reason you’re learning to fly in the first place. But the same reasons these trips are so much fun - new places to see, a goal at the end of the flight - can lead to challenges if you aren’t prepared.</p> <h3 id=review_1>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    When it comes to weather, wait for a sure thing. If you’ve been waiting on the clouds to lift or for the visibility to improve, don’t take off until you think there’s a very good chance of success.</p> <p>2.    Know what kind of air mass you’re flying in. We’ve talked a lot about weather in this course, but one of the key questions to ask is whether the air mass you’re flying in is unstable or stable.</p> <p>3.    Always have an out. This cliche is often used with weather, and that’s very true, but it’s equally applicable to fuel planning. If changing weather conditions mean you can’t make your destination, have a good Plan B in mind.</p> <p>4.    Slow down. No matter how well you plan the flight, something will inevitably go wrong. When that happens - and especially if you’re frustrated by it - force yourself to slow down and double check your last few steps.</p> <p>5.    Understand the terrain. If you’re crossing a mountain range or even just flying over some foothills, consider the effect such terrain can have on your flight.</p> <p>6.    Use technology wisely. Recent advances in technology have made cross country flying easier and safer, and you should use these tools without hesitation.</p> <h2 id=class-c-and-b-airport-operations>Class C and B Airport Operations<a class=headerlink href=#class-c-and-b-airport-operations title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 3</em></p> <p>Once you have mastered communications at a smaller Class D airport, moving on to an airport in Class C and B airspace is not that much more difficult.</p> <h3 id=review_2>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    You will likely find Tower, Ground, and Clearance Delivery controllers and an ATIS broadcast, much like you may have found at the slower airport.</p> <p>2.    Class C and B airspace will add approach and departure controllers to guide you into and out of the airspace.</p> <p>3.    The process will tend to be well aligned with the Aeronautical Information Manual and you will usually have fewer "non-standard" surprises.</p> <p>4.    The outer ring of Class C airspace is typically ten nautical miles from the center of the airport. An uncharted outer area will generally extend out to twenty nautical miles. You should contact approach control within the outer area, well before reaching the charted outer ring.</p> <p>5.    As with Class D airspace, listen to the ATIS broadcast before making initial contact with the controller.</p> <p>6.    During your initial contact with approach, advise the controller that you have the appropriate ATIS and your intentions. You will find a sector based approach control frequency on the Sectional chart. This frequency may also be found in the chart supplement.</p> <p>7.    If the approach controller does not acknowledge the airplane's call sign, in the eyes of the FAA, radio contact has not been established.</p> <p>8.    As you get closer to the airport, the approach controller will hand you off to the tower controller. The controller may not provide this frequency. You can be prepared by looking this frequency up prior to the handoff and having it set as your standby frequency. Alternatively, you can ask the controller for the frequency.</p> <p>9.    When you are ready to depart from the primary airport in Class Charlie airspace, a logical flow will help you to exit smoothly.</p> <p>10.  First listen to the ATIS frequency. At busier airports, it may be best to listen to ATIS before starting your engine.</p> <p>11.  At a tower-controlled field inside Class C or Class B airspace, your first ground contact with ATC will generally be on the clearance delivery frequency. This controller will provide the VFR clearance for your flight and may provide you with a unique transponder squawk code.</p> <p>12.  Taxi from your parking spot to the edge of the nonmovement area and contact ground for permission to taxi.</p> <p>13.  Continue to monitor ground frequency while completing your before takeoff checks. When ready to go, contact the tower.</p> <p>14.  Shortly after your takeoff, the tower will hand you off to departure. Change to the frequency assigned with your clearance.</p> <p>15.  The departure controller may continue to give you radar vectors or he may allow you to resume your own navigation. Be careful, "resume own navigation" does not release you from the controller. It simply allows you to follow your own course.</p> <p>16.  Once you are clear of the controller's airspace you will be specifically released from the frequency. Then and only then are you permitted to change from the controller's frequency.</p> <p>17.  Class B airspace is found around several of the busiest airports in the US. Radio communications for VFR flights to or from a Class B airport are not that much different than operations at a Class C airport.</p> <p>18.  There are regulatory differences between Class C and B airspace; the airspace and radio may be busier, but the communication procedures are very similar.</p> <p>19.  The shape of Class B airspace will be unique to the needs of the area. Your initial contact with the controllers should occur well outside the depicted airspace.</p> <p>20.  Five to ten miles outside the Class Bravo should provide sufficient time to get permission to enter the controlled area.</p> <p>21.  You must get explicit permission to enter Class B airspace. Simply establishing radio contact does not allow you to enter as it did with Class C and D airspace.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-your-deceptive-flying-mind>Closer Look: Your Deceptive Flying Mind<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-your-deceptive-flying-mind title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 4</em></p> <p>You’ll probably realize early on in your flying career that being a pilot has a lot more to do with mental skills than physical ones. Here are some maladies that can affect the mind of a pilot.</p> <h3 id=review_3>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_3 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Auto-rough is an engine malady that might strike you when you are flying at night, or over rough terrain.</p> <p>2.    The engine seemingly develops an insidious, underlying, grinding noise, or maybe it sounds like one of the spark plugs isn't firing properly.</p> <p>3.    You're sure it doesn't sound like it's supposed to. All the gauges look normal and nobody else in the cabin notices anything out of the ordinary – that's auto rough.</p> <p>4.    There is another affliction that affects pilots, and is more serious– it's called get-there-itis.</p> <p>5.    The pilot decides to fly even though the weather isn't good. He just has to get there.</p> <p>6.    Another example of get-there-itis is trying to stretch the fuel range of the airplane. He says something like, "There should be just enough fuel to make it."</p> <p>7.    Fuel exhaustion is the number one cause of engine failure.</p> <p>8.    Pilots are also susceptible to the thinking of "I made it last time".</p> <p>9.    If you took off on a recent flight when the weather was bad, but you made it to your destination anyway, make sure you don’t you can always get away with the same poor decision making.</p> <p>10.  Lastly, watch out for "expectation bias", which occurs when you hear and react to what you expect to hear, not what was actually said by ATC.</p> <h2 id=flight-plans>Flight Plans<a class=headerlink href=#flight-plans title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 5</em></p> <p>In this section we'll discuss filing a VFR flight plan and why this is important.</p> <h3 id=review_4>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_4 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    If you have a flight plan on file, and something happens to you along the way, someone will know to begin looking for you.</p> <p>2.    There are several ways to file a VFR flight plan, including calling Flight Service at</p> <p>1-800-WX-BRIEF, filing online using the Flight Service website at <a href=http://www.1800wxbrief.com/ >www.1800wxbrief.com</a> or by using the plan filing feature found in many aviation apps.</p> <p>3.    You'll enter information about the planned flight, including aircraft N#, type and designation, special equipment, true airspeed, departure point, proposed time off, and cruising altitude.</p> <p>4.    Continuing, supply your destination, estimated time en route, remarks, fuel on board, a possible alternate airport, personal data, the number of people on board, and the color of the airplane.</p> <p>5.    Usually you will file the plan at the same time you get your weather briefing.</p> <p>6.    You can also file a flight plan in the air by radio.</p> <p>7.    You can open your flight plan either electronically from your mobile app, or over the radio through Flight Service.</p> <p>8.    Close your flight plan on arrival. If you don't, first responders will start to search for you 30 minutes after your estimated time of arrival.</p> <p>9.    Close your flight plan by calling Flight Service on the phone, or using the Close feature in your mobile app, after you have landed. You can also close by radio in the air when you have the destination in sight and are very close to landing.</p> <p>10.  If you're planning on a fuel stop or lunch along the way – that can be noted in the remarks section. However, if you're planning on stopping for more than an hour, a separate flight plan is recommended.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-runway-markings>Closer Look: Runway Markings<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-runway-markings title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 6</em></p> <p>In this section we'll discuss two ways runways are marked – the displaced threshold and the closed runway.</p> <h3 id=review_5>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_5 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The threshold of a runway is the designated beginning of the runway available for landing. Sometimes the threshold is not where the runway pavement begins – it has a displaced threshold. Touchdown should not occur prior to the threshold.</p> <p>2.    This may be for reasons of obstacle clearance, pavement stability, or even noise abatement.</p> <p>3.    The paved area behind this displaced runway threshold can be used for taxiing, landing rollout, and the beginning of the takeoff roll.</p> <p>4.    No operations should be conducted in an area marked with chevrons.</p> <p>5.    A large X at either end of the runway signifies a closed runway.</p> <p>6.    Look up the more complicated markings in the aeronautical information manual.</p> <h2 id=weight-and-balance>Weight and Balance<a class=headerlink href=#weight-and-balance title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 7</em></p> <p>In this section we'll come to realize that a lot of the performance and handling characteristics of an airplane are a function of weight and balance.</p> <h3 id=review_6>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_6 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    In most 4-place or larger airplanes, you can either fill up the fuel tanks, or fill up the seats, but not both at the same time.</p> <p>2.    A maximum weight limitation is imposed on an airplane for safety. The performance of the airplane is affected by weight.</p> <p>3.    The weight and balance data is specific to an airplane; it will be in the POH or in the weight and balance data papers for each airplane.</p> <p>4.    The basic empty weight includes the airframe, engine, all permanently installed equipment or accessories, unusable fuel, and full engine oil.</p> <p>5.    Full oil is not included in the empty weight of some airplanes.</p> <p>6.    Be sure that the airplane's weight is within limits. Add the weight of the people, useable fuel, and baggage to the basic empty weight of the airplane.</p> <p>7.    Aviation gasoline weighs six pounds per gallon.</p> <p>8.    The balance part of weight and balance is equally important. The center of gravity, CG, is the point at which the airplane would balance – just like a teeter-totter.</p> <p>9.    If the CG is too far forward, the elevator may not be able to rotate the nose up high enough for takeoff, or to keep from hitting on the nose wheel on landing.</p> <p>10.  Getting the CG too far aft is even more critical. The farther aft the CG, the less stable the airplane becomes in pitch.</p> <p>11.  The datum is a reference point on the airplane from which you measure certain items. For example, on the 172, the datum is the front face of the firewall, and you measure distance from that point for balance calculations.</p> <p>12.  This distance is called arm.</p> <p>13.  The effect of a given weight at a certain distance is called moment.</p> <p>14.  Moment is the arm multiplied by the weight, and because it is inches times pounds, moment is stated in inch-pounds, or pound-inches.</p> <p>15.  The arm and moment of the empty airplane, or sometimes only the moment, is given in the Pilot's Operating Handbook or the weight and balance papers for the airplane.</p> <p>16.  No matter how the information is presented you must find the total moment for the airplane as it is loaded.</p> <p>17.  You will want to practice a number of weight and balance problems to become proficient in these calculations.</p> <p>18.  In some airplanes, you could takeoff within balance limits, and end up with the center of gravity outside the limit, simply because of the amount of fuel burned during flight.</p> <p>19.  Some airplanes are certified in both the normal and utility categories, with a wider range of maneuvers allowed in the utility category.</p> <p>20.  The utility category usually results in a much smaller allowable CG and weight range because of spin recovery requirements.</p> <p>21.  You can also practice some weight and balance problems using an electronic calculator.</p> <p>22.  Sometimes, at the end of your calculations, the CG is either forward or aft of the CG limit.</p> <p>23.  You will have to move or remove someone or something to bring the CG back in its envelope.</p> <p>24.  To do this, it's sometimes as easy as eliminating some of the fuel or adjusting the position of some of the passengers or baggage.</p> <p>25.  Weight and balance is rather simple. Weight times arm equals moment. Total moment divided by weight equals the center of gravity.</p> <p>26.  Maximum ramp weight may be slightly higher than maximum takeoff weight in order to take into consideration fuel burned in starting and taxiing.</p> <p>27.  Another weight limitation in some airplanes is maximum landing weight.</p> <p>28.  Useful load is the difference between the maximum ramp or takeoff weight and the empty weight of the airplane.</p> <p>29.  You'll have a favorite airplane or two that you will fly most often. Their weight and balance limitations will become familiar to you, so you won't need to recalculate for every trip.</p> <h2 id=air-facts-a-balanced-approach>Air Facts: A Balanced Approach<a class=headerlink href=#air-facts-a-balanced-approach title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 8</em></p> <p>In this section we'll investigate how some airplanes perform when loaded right up to their aft CG.</p> <h3 id=review_7>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_7 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Your calculations have two parts: weight and balance. Many pilots spend a lot of time thinking about the first part: can I take full fuel? How many passengers can come along today? What’s my gross weight? Don’t neglect the C.G. calculation. It has a direct impact on the performance and handling characteristics of your airplane.</p> <p>2.    An airplane is stable when, if it's disturbed in pitch, it'll dampen itself out. Or, when you reduce the airspeed below the trim airspeed, it'll return to the trim airspeed in a few oscillations.</p> <p>3.    Some airplanes may be almost unstable if they are loaded right up to the aft CG. Going beyond it is always a bad idea.</p> <p>4.    Weight and balance limitations on an airplane are absolutes.</p> <p>5.    Once you've figured your weight and balance and there's any doubt at all, readjust some factor to move the center of gravity more toward the center.</p> <h2 id=the-knowledge-test-and-oral-exam>The Knowledge Test and Oral Exam<a class=headerlink href=#the-knowledge-test-and-oral-exam title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 9</em></p> <p>In this section we'll investigate preparing for your computerized knowledge test and the oral portion of the flight test.</p> <h3 id=review_8>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_8 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    When you're ready for the written, your instructor will advise you of your options.</p> <p>2.    You can get the administrative requirements out to the way by making an appointment and paying by credit card over the phone.</p> <p>3.    Take a flight computer and/or a calculator along. They are allowed as long as any permanent memory is erased both before and after the test. You may also use a plotter during the test.</p> <p>4.    You are allowed two-and-a-half hours for the private pilot test. An hour and a half is allowed for the recreational to private pilot transition test.</p> <p>5.    A photo ID, such as a driver's license, passport, or other government identification card is required.</p> <p>6.    You must also have a logbook endorsement from your flight or ground instructor stating that you have completed a course of study in preparation for the written portion of the test.</p> <p>7.    You'll be given an orientation which lasts approximately 15 minutes. This introduction includes a sample test allowing you to get comfortable with the surroundings and the computer.</p> <p>8.    You'll then receive a packet which contains a book with the charts and figures, scratch paper, and an overlay needed for the test. Remember, you may not mark in the test booklet, only on the scratch paper and overlay.</p> <p>9.    The private pilot test is 60 questions out of the 900 or so possible. The test to transition from recreational to private pilot has 30 questions.</p> <p>10.  The questions are multiple choice with 3 alternatives offered for each question. You must choose the most correct answer.</p> <p>11.  Take your time and be sure that you understand the question before considering the possible answers.</p> <p>12.  Answer the questions you readily know and then go back to the ones you find difficult.</p> <p>13.  Save the computational and look-up questions for later in the test.</p> <p>14.  When you're finished, you can choose to use the remainder of your time to review or quit.</p> <p>15.  A score of 70 percent is passing. If you don't pass, you can retest once you have a new logbook endorsement from an instructor certifying that you've had ground instruction and are competent to pass the test.</p> <p>16.  Your test is scored immediately and is valid for 24 calendar months. The oral and flight portions of the test must be completed within that time period.</p> <p>17.  The oral and flight tests are usually given on the same day back-to-back. When you are ready, your flight instructor will help you make an appointment with an FAA inspector or designated flight examiner.</p> <p>18.  Study the private pilot airman certification standards. It outlines what will be expected of you.</p> <p>19.  For the aircraft you'll need a view limiting device, the required aircraft documents, current charts, a computer and plotter, a flight plan form, flight logs, and a current AIM.</p> <p>20.  You'll also need your student pilot and medical certificate or your recreational and medical certificate if you're transitioning, a completed 8710-1 airman certificate and/or rating application, the form with your written test results, your logbook with your instructor's endorsement, your notice of disapproval if this is a second try, and the examiner's fee.</p> <p>21.  Some examiners are using IACRA instead of the paper 8710. It's an electronic, web based system, that helps reduce errors and streamlines FAA paperwork.</p> <p>22.  The examiner or inspector will also have to see some form of picture identification before the test can be administered. A driver's license, passport, or armed forces ID will be fine.</p> <p>23.  The oral, preflight, part of the test is given to make certain that you are knowledgeable in various areas. Much of what is covered will have been on the written.</p> <p>24.  Make sure that you can point out all of the required records in the aircraft's logbook.</p> <p>25.  The examiner will make sure of your knowledge of aviation weather and your ability to obtain, read, and analyze it.</p> <p>26.  You'll be asked to explain the whole range of important aviation topics relating to your level of certificate; weight and balance, performance charts, sectional chart, and the like.</p> <p>27.  You will have to prepare a flight plan and a navigation log. Then you will simulate filing your plan.</p> <p>28.  The examiner will make sure you are knowledgeable on aeromedical factors and the effects of alcohol and drugs.</p> <p>29.  If you don't know the answer to a question, admit it. Then immediately offer to look it up and find the answer.</p> <p>30.  Be courteous and complete and you shouldn't have any problems.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-aopa-and-eaa>Closer Look: AOPA and EAA<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-aopa-and-eaa title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 10</em></p> <p>In this section we'll investigate the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association – the AOPA.</p> <h3 id=review_9>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_9 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The AOPA is the world's largest civil aviation organization, representing people who own or fly general aviation aircraft.

Know the recommended flaps setting. Align the airplane carefully on the runway. Apply aileron deflection as required and smoothly apply maximum power.</p> <p>11.  Rotate at the recommended speed, establish a wind drift correction as necessary, and accelerate to VY, the best rate of climb speed.</p> <p>12.  If flaps were used, they should be retracted as recommended. Complete the after takeoff checklist and depart the pattern in an acceptable way.</p> <p>13.  The examiner will expect you to be able to explain and/or perform a short-field takeoff.</p> <p>14.  You may also be asked to explain and/or perform a soft-field takeoff.</p> <p>15.  In the navigation phase, the examiner may ask you to explain pilotage and dead reckoning, and will want to make sure that you can follow that pre-planned course, identify landmarks, and navigate by means of pre-computed headings, groundspeed, and elapsed time.</p> <p>16.  You'll be expected to correct for and record differences between preflight calculations and what actually happens en route.</p> <p>17.  In using navigation systems, you may be asked for an explanation of how these work, and you will be expected to use them properly en route, including locating yourself relative to the radio navigation facility or waypoint.</p> <p>18.  Diverting from the original flight plan is on the test, and you are expected to know how to recognize adverse weather and know the procedures for diverting.</p> <p>19.  You will perform lost procedures as well.</p> <p>20.  You will be asked to fly the airplane solely by reference to instruments including demonstrating your ability to recover from unusual attitudes.</p> <p>21.  Stalls, slow flight, steep turns, and ground reference maneuvers are also tested.</p> <p>22.  A discussion of night flying will be part of your test. The examiner will ask you to explain the preparation, equipment, and factors essential to night flight.</p> <p>23.  A simulated forced landing will most likely be included. You'll be expected to know the proper airspeeds, use of the emergency checklist, and to attempt to determine the reason for the simulated malfunction.</p> <p>24.  Landings are next on the test. If there is a crosswind, it must be handled properly. If there is no crosswind, the examiner will ask how you would handle a crosswind landing.</p> <p>25.  Slips to a landing, go-arounds, soft-field and short-field landings will also be part of the test.</p> <p>26.  After the last landing, don't forget to use the after landing and shutdown checklists. Park and secure the airplane properly.</p> <h2 id=air-factstraining-beyond-the-checkride>Air Facts:Training Beyond the Checkride<a class=headerlink href=#air-factstraining-beyond-the-checkride title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 12</em></p> <p>There’s no doubt your checkride was conducted within the parameters of the ACS and you demonstrated quality decision making skills and judgment, but that’s just the beginning. Earning a pilot certificate is a special accomplishment. It also comes with the responsibility to continue learning and refining those skills through practice.</p> <h3 id=review_11>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_11 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Creating a plan for continued learning will only enhance your aviation experiences and provide even greater personal enrichment.</p> <p>2.    Start out by making a plan to continuously improve your landings. A wise person once said you can’t practice anything effectively unless you have goals and a method to measure progress.</p> <p>3.    Judge your improvement on the quality of your “bad” landings. And practice under a variety of conditions like wind, configuration, and time of day to better hone your visual cues and mastery of the airplane.</p> <p>4.    Next make it a habit to continually practice abnormal procedures. Read the insightful section of your POH that includes an expanded discussion of abnormal and emergency procedures.</p> <p>5.    On your next flight, review the table of contents for the emergency section and select an event you haven’t practiced. Follow the checklist for that item and understand the “why” behind it.</p> <p>6.    Finally, fly. There’s nothing better for proficiency than to fly more and visit new places.</p> <h2 id=high-performance-and-complex-airplanes>High Performance and Complex Airplanes<a class=headerlink href=#high-performance-and-complex-airplanes title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 13</em></p> <p>Once you acquire your private pilot certificate, there are many things you can do. Among them is carrying passengers and flying almost anywhere VFR day or night. You'll be able to fly any airplanes for which you are rated – probably single-engine land to begin with.</p> <h3 id=review_12>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_12 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    At this point in your journey, you may want to check out in either a complex or high performance airplane. To do this you will have to be checked out by a flight instructor and have your logbook certified.</p> <p>2.    There is also a grouping called Technically Advanced Aircraft, or T-A-A. This means the aircraft has an electronic Primary Flight Display, Multi Function Display and two-axis autopilot. You do not need a special endorsement to fly this type of airplane.</p> <p>3.    Get a copy of the pilot's operating handbook, which includes the checklists, and read it through, making notes of any questions that you want to ask the flight instructor.</p> <p>4.    In the POH of more complex airplanes, you'll find more speeds defined for certain operations. Review all your V speeds.</p> <p>5.    Many of these speeds decrease when the weight of the aircraft is lighter than maximum takeoff weight because of fuel burn or empty seats.</p> <p>6.    Vle is the maximum speed you can fly with the landing gear extended,and Vlo is the maximum speed you can extend or retract the landing gear.</p> <p>7.    This may be your first experience with a constant-speed propeller. Engine RPM is controlled and changed by changing the pitch of the propeller.</p> <p>8.    The propeller control affects the RPM gauge – tachometer. The manifold pressure gauge is more directly controlled with the throttle.</p> <p>9.    You'll find on the before takeoff checklist, instructions on how to cycle the propeller, to make sure everything is working properly.</p> <ol> <li> <p>When the prop control is full forward the propeller pitch is low and the RPM will be high. When the prop control is full back, the pitch of the prop and the RPM will be lower.</p> </li> <li> <p>The advantage of a constant-speed propeller over a fixed-pitch prop is in greater propeller efficiency over a wide speed range.</p> </li> <li> <p>After takeoff, if noise abatement is a consideration, climb at the best rate of climb speed, maintain maximum allowable power until reaching an altitude which will allow an emergency landing, then reduce power to the cruise climb power setting. Reducing RPM does more than anything else to quiet the airplane for those on the ground.</p> </li> <li> <p>When it comes time to reduce power, the generally preferred way to do it is to reduce the manifold pressure first and then reduce the RPM.</p> </li> <li> <p>Not all high-performance airplanes with a constant speed propeller have a propeller control. For example, you'll only find a throttle and mixture control in the cockpit of a Cirrus SR-22, despite it having a constant-speed propeller. The propeller linkage is interconnected with the throttle control – as you adjust power, the propeller is automatically set.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the aircraft is equipped with cowl flaps, they will have been open for the takeoff and climb and should be closed for cruise except in very hot weather, or as dictated by the engine temperatures or the checklist.</p> </li> <li> <p>Most high performance airplanes have fuel injected engines. One advantage, more precise leaning is possible. An exhaust gas temperature gauge is usually available to help with this.</p> </li> <li> <p>A possible disadvantage to fuel injection is in harder starting when the engine is hot because of vapor lock. Follow the POH for proper hot starting.</p> </li> <li> <p>A turbocharger is an exhaust driven supercharger – an air pump that maintains or increases manifold pressure to make available more power, or in some airplanes, to maintain sea level manifold pressure and thus power to a higher altitude.</p> </li> <li> <p>It's especially important to watch the cylinder head temperature when flying turbocharged aircraft at high altitudes where the thin air doesn't cool the engines as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>In regard to retractable landing gear, what the FAA suggests is to leave it extended until a landing can no longer be made on the remaining runway.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before retracting the gear, always make sure you have established a positive rate of climb and have enough altitude to get the wheels back down if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>When landing, always establish a place to extend the gear. You will be less likely to forget. Downwind is a good place, as is three miles out on a straight in approach or base leg entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>One thing you'll notice when you move up to faster airplanes is an increased requirement to trim. A rudder trim system might also be included.</p> </li> <li> <p>You do have to step up your rate of thinking and acting when flying a faster airplane, requiring you to plan descents more carefully. A GPS and its VNAV function can be a big help here.</p> </li> <li> <p>High-performance airplanes with larger engines are more susceptible to shock cooling, compared to those found in training airplanes. Factor the power settings into your descent planning, and reduce the power by only one or two inches of manifold pressure per minute, to allow the engine temperatures to come down slowly as you approach the airport traffic pattern.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id=cessna-182-skylane>Cessna 182 Skylane<a class=headerlink href=#cessna-182-skylane title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 14</em></p> <p>Once you acquire your private pilot certificate, you might want to step up to something with more performance than your trainers. The Cessna Skylane with the G1000 system would be a great choice.</p> <h3 id=review_13>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_13 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The Cessna Skylane seats four and cruises at 140 knots. It's powered by a 230 horsepower Lycoming engine.</p> <p>2.    If you haven't flown with the G1000 or one of the other glass panel packages available, you will be amazed at what they can do.</p> <p>3.    Learning these sophisticated avionics will take some time but the effort is highly rewarding.</p> <p>4.    You can input a flight plan before takeoff and the GPS will lead you to your destination. You can even load and follow a vertical descent profile from the cruise portion of the flight plan.</p> <p>5.    Even better, this airplane has a fully integrated GFC 700 autopilot installed. Turn it on after leaving the traffic pattern and it can lead you to your destination.</p> <p>6.    The Skylane has a good useful load and also has a generous 88 gallon fuel capacity. This fuel amount will yield approximately six and a half hours of total flying.</p> <p>7.    The Skylane's maximum takeoff weight limitation won't allow full fuel with all four seats filled and some baggage. This is remedied by not completely filling up the tanks prior to departure.</p> <p>8.    The excellent takeoff and landing performance of the Skylane does a good job on all but the shortest runways. Its handling qualities are impressive as well.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-remote-communications>Closer Look: Remote Communications<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-remote-communications title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 15</em></p> <p>In this section we will investigate remote communications with certain ground facilities.</p> <h3 id=review_14>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_14 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Communication with ground stations can often take place through remote communications outlets, even when you're not line of sight with the facility itself.</p> <p>2.    For example, you can talk to the Boise flight service station when in the Redfish Lake area through the Stanley remote communications outlet.</p> <p>3.    Many NAVAIDs also have remote communication capabilities.</p> <p>4.    For example, in the area of Falmouth, Kentucky, you would communicate with the Louisville flight service station by transmitting on 122.1 and listening over the VOR frequency of 117.0.</p> <p>5.    You may not be able to tune some frequencies on your radio. Your system skips over them. That's because some older radios aren't capable of picking up frequencies put into use since they were manufactured.</p> <p>6.    Some newer radios require a special procedure to get these frequencies. For instance, to tune 126.67 on your radio, you may have to pull out a special knob.</p> <p>7.    If you're not able to communicate on a particular frequency, let someone know at that same facility on a different frequency. They'll give you instructions on what to do.</p> <h2 id=expanding-horizons>Expanding Horizons<a class=headerlink href=#expanding-horizons title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 6 – Video Segment 16</em></p> <p>In this section we will investigate some of the opportunities that general aviation presents to the holder of the private pilot certificate – especially, night and instrument flying.</p> <h3 id=review_15>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_15 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    It's obvious that a lot of things are different at night. You can't see the horizon, terrain details, or weather formations as well as in the daylight. A night cross-country can be a lot more like an instrument cross-country.</p> <p>2.    One of the biggest challenges at night can be finding the airport. They don't look the same in the dark.</p> <p>3.    Even the alternating green and white beacon can be hidden in the background lights of a city.</p> <p>4.    If you use a combination of visual and radio navigation, you will be successful.</p> <p>5.    There are two advantages that night flying has over daytime; the traffic is less and ATC is not as busy.</p> <p>6.    Before you fly a solo night VFR cross-country make sure the weather is almost perfect – it's difficult to see and avoid clouds in the dark.</p> <p>7.    Plan every detail of the flight carefully, including how you are going to take advantage of the avionics in navigating.</p> <p>8.    Bring extra flashlights and spend some time in the cockpit, in the dark, before heading out to get used to it all.</p> <p>9.    If you are going with an instructor, pick out a large airport in a metropolitan area, and a smaller airport with minimum runway lighting, no VASI, and few lights in the vicinity.</p> <p>10.  While a low percentage of VFR flying is done at night, a high percentage of the weather-related accidents occur at night.</p> <p>11.  There are many interesting aspects of aviation to accomplish; aerobatic flight, seaplanes, soaring, multiengine rating, helicopter, and especially acquiring an instrument rating.</p> <p>12.  With an instrument rating you can venture almost anywhere except that part of the sky that is filled with thunderstorms and ice.</p> <p>13.  You can do more things, go more places, make more plans, meet more schedules, and have more fun.</p> <p>14.  In studying for your instrument rating, you will become better versed in weather analysis, your flying precision will be sharpened, and your overall knowledge of the complete aviation system will be greatly enhanced.</p> <p>15.  Getting an instrument rating opens your day horizons a lot, and your night flying horizons even more.</p> <p>16.  You'll need a total of 40 hours of actual or simulated instrument time, including a long cross-country, 15 hours with an authorized instructor, 3 of those hours within 60 days of</p> <p>the test. Your logbook must reflect 50 hours of cross-country as pilot in command, 10 of which must be in airplanes.</p> <p>17.  Possibly, once you get the rating, you'll make most of your trips IFR – both for the practice and for the convenience.</p> <p>18.  Flying is a privilege to be protected and cherished. You do this by always putting safety first.</p> <p>19.  Have fun and share your aviation enthusiasm and knowledge with others. This will attract more people to general aviation and help it grow into the future.</p> <form class=md-feedback name=feedback hidden> <fieldset> <legend class=md-feedback__title> Was this page helpful? </legend> <div class=md-feedback__inner> <div class=md-feedback__list> <button class="md-feedback__icon md-icon" type=submit title="This page was helpful" data-md-value=1> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 12a8 8 0 0 0-8-8 8 8 0 0 0-8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8-8m2 0a10 10 0 0 1-10 10A10 10 0 0 1 2 12 10 10 0 0 1 12 2a10 10 0 0 1 10 10M10 9.5c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S7 10.3 7 9.5 7.7 8 8.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m7 0c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S14 10.3 14 9.5 14.7 8 15.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m-5 7.73c-1.75 0-3.29-.73-4.19-1.81L9.23 14c.45.72 1.52 1.23 2.77 1.23s2.32-.51 2.77-1.23l1.42 1.42c-.9 1.08-2.44 1.81-4.19 1.81"/></svg> </button> <button class="md-feedback__icon md-icon" type=submit title="This page could be improved" data-md-value=0> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 12a8 8 0 0 0-8-8 8 8 0 0 0-8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8-8m2 0a10 10 0 0 1-10 10A10 10 0 0 1 2 12 10 10 0 0 1 12 2a10 10 0 0 1 10 10m-6.5-4c.8 0 1.5.7 1.5 1.5s-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5-1.5-.7-1.5-1.5.7-1.5 1.5-1.5M10 9.5c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S7 10.3 7 9.5 7.7 8 8.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m2 4.5c1.75 0 3.29.72 4.19 1.81l-1.42 1.42C14.32 16.5 13.25 16 12 16s-2.32.5-2.77 1.23l-1.42-1.42C8.71 14.72 10.25 14 12 14"/></svg> </button> </div> <div class=md-feedback__note> <div data-md-value=1 hidden> Thanks for your feedback! </div> <div data-md-value=0 hidden> Thanks for your feedback!
