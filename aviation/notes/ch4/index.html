id=night-flying>Night Flying<a class=headerlink href=#night-flying title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 1</em></p> <p>In this section we'll introduce you to night vision, airport lighting, and give you tips to help you with your night flying experience. You'll find that night flying is quite enjoyable since the air usually is calm and smooth.</p> <h3 id=review>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    To acquire your private certificate, you must have at least three hours of night dual instruction that includes a cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles and 10 takeoffs and 10 full-stop landings.</p> <p>2.    Night flying is not difficult, but it differs from daylight operations in that vision is restricted at night.</p> <p>3.    There are techniques you can learn to enhance your night vision. For example, during the day the best way to see something is by looking directly at it. But at night, objects are best seen by viewing them slightly off center.</p> <p>4.    Also, you'll learn to avoid bright, white light before you fly to let your eyes adjust to the dark – called dark adaptation.</p> <p>5.    To help maintain dark adaptation, keep the cockpit and instrument lights at a low light setting. Red is best here.</p> <p>6.    As part of a night preflight, check the position lights which are red for the left wing, green for the right, and white for the tail. Also check the anticollision lights and the landing lights for proper operation.</p> <p>7.    Next check the instrument panel lights. The FARs require a spare set or three spares of each kind of fuse to be on board.</p> <p>8.    Have a flashlight in good operating condition on board such as a small one that can be carried in a shirt pocket or hung around the neck.</p> <p>9.    Taxi slowly at night. A lighted taxiway has blue lights. A civilian use airport has a beacon that flashes alternately white and green.</p> <p>10.  Military airports have beacons that show two quick white flashes between green flashes.</p> <p>11.  Obstructions have red lights.</p> <p>12.  When ready for takeoff, turn on the landing and anticollision lights.</p> <p>13.  Notice that the runway threshold or end of the runway is marked with green lights. Some airports have runway threshold lights that are green on the approach side, and red on the runway side.</p> <p>14.  Runway end identifier lights are pulsating white strobe lights.</p> <p>15.  Runways have white edge lights. Once in the middle of the runway, check to ensure the heading indicator and runway headings are the same.</p> <p>16.  It will seem like you're moving faster than usual because you have no normal visual cues as in daylight.</p> <p>17.  The location of navigation lights on an aircraft will help you determine the direction of the other aircraft. If you see a red light, you have the left wingtip in view and it's passing from your right to your left and has the right-of-way. If you see a white light and a flashing red or white light, you are looking at the tail of an airplane. A green light indicates you are seeing an airplane's right wing and it is moving from your left to right, and you have the right-of-way. An aircraft displaying both red and green lights will be approaching head on.</p> <p>18.  Regulations state that navigation lights must be on anytime an airplane is taxiing or flying during the entire period from sunset to sunrise.</p> <p>19.  Night is defined as the time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.</p> <p>20.  At night, it's important to know your position at all times when away from the airport.</p> <p>21.  Some airports have radio controlled runway lights. Click the microphone 7 times within 5 seconds to activate the highest intensity lights available. Once activated, they remain illuminated for 15 minutes.</p> <p>22.  Keep the runway lights in sight as you enter the pattern. Do your before landing checklist. Use the landing light to determine when to start your flare.</p> <p>23.  Practice landing without a landing light as well – what if it burns out?</p> <p>24.  A VASI system is a great help for night landing. Two bar VASI's can be seen from 3 to 5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles at night.</p> <p>25.  When using a VASI, don't start your descent until the airplane is aligned with the runway.</p> <p>26.  With the two bar VASI, if you see red over white, you are all right – meaning you are on the glidepath. Below the glidepath both bars would be red, and above the glidepath both bars would be white.</p> <p>27.  A system with all light units installed in a single row is called a precision approach path indicator – PAPI. There are 2 and 4-light systems.</p> <p>28.  For the two light system, if you are on the glidepath, you will see a combination of red and white. If both lights are white, you're too high. If you see all red, you're too low.</p> <p>29.  A tri-color visual glide slope indicator is a single light unit that shows three colors. If you are on the glidepath you'll see green. Below the glidepath, you'll see red. Above the glidepath you'll see amber.</p> <p>30.  During the night, you can experience many illusions which can lead to landing errors. For example, when landing over darkened areas it seems like the airplane is higher than it actually is. Straight lights along a road can be mistaken for runway lights. Bright runway lights with few lights illuminating the surrounding area may create the illusion of less distance to the runway – the converse is also true.</p> <p>31.  Be aware of your approach speed. Use the same speed that you would use during the day.</p> <h2 id=air-facts-the-night-shift>Air Facts: The Night Shift<a class=headerlink href=#air-facts-the-night-shift title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 2</em></p> <p>In this section we'll discuss some differences between night and day flying.</p> <h3 id=review_1>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Because you can see well during the day doesn't mean you can do the same at night. Age and physical condition can play a significant role here.</p> <p>2.    Since you can't see as well as in daylight, you need to develop some techniques to help out.</p> <p>3.    If you takeoff and climb out over an area where there are few or no lights, maintaining attitude by visual reference to a horizon will be quite difficult. You are now flying on instruments.</p> <p>4.    Checking altitude at night like you do during the day doesn't work at night. You need to frequently check the altimeter to verify a safe altitude.</p> <p>5.    Pay particular attention to the lighting activation method in the airport/facility directory -- some airports use a separate frequency other than the CTAF, which can catch you off guard if not prepared.</p> <p>6.    As you make the turn to final, watch for the visual approach glide slope to come into view, in either the form of a VASI or PAPI.</p> <p>7.    Something else to consider when on final at night is that there is a better chance for wildlife to hang out near the runway as things cool off.</p> <h2 id=aviation-charts-and-notams>Aviation Charts and NOTAMs<a class=headerlink href=#aviation-charts-and-notams title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 3</em></p> <p>This segment covers the different types of visual navigation charts, the Chart Supplement publication and various types of Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs).</p> <h3 id=review_2>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The primary charts you’ll learn to first use are the VFR Sectional, VFR Terminal Area, and Flyway Planning Charts.</p> <p>2.    Sectional charts are designed for visual navigation and are named for a major city within the area of coverage.</p> <p>3.    VFR Terminal Area charts are similar to Sectional charts in that they are designed for visual navigation of slow and medium speed aircraft. As the name implies, these charts are used in congested terminal areas since they provide greater detail and clarity of information.</p> <p>4.    Some terminal area charts feature "VFR waypoints," marked with a 4-point star. Visual check points can be used to identify your position to A-T-C.</p> <p>5.    In addition to print, there are digital versions of each of these VFR charts available for mobile devices, like in the ForeFlight app.</p> <p>6.    Digital charts are much easier to keep up to date, thanks to the app’s ability to download the new data for each update cycle. And you can view your airplane’s position right on the sectional chart for better situational awareness when your iPad is connected to a GPS position source.</p> <p>7.    To view a VFR Flyway chart in ForeFlight, select that option from the map layers menu and it will be displayed on the moving map screen.</p> <p>8.    For additional information about airports and ATC facilities, check out the Chart Supplement. This print version of this publication is issued in nine volumes for the U.S., Puerto Rico, Alaska and the Pacific, with each volume covering a specific geographic area.</p> <p>9.    The Chart Supplement contains a wealth of information, including an Airport/Facility Directory (known as the A-F-D for short), VOR receiver test information, communication frequencies and telephone numbers for ATC facilities and airport taxiway diagrams.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Chart Supplement is updated every 56 days and is available in a variety of formats, including as a printed book and online in PDF format, searchable by airport from the FAA website.</p> </li> <li> <p>During preflight planning, you will need to check the Notices to Air Missions, called NOTAMs for short. These notices are considered essential to flight safety and contain information not known sufficiently in advance to publicize by other means.</p> </li> <li> <p>NOTAMs are classed as Domestic NOTAMs, Flight Data Center, or FDC, NOTAMs, International NOTAMs, or Military NOTAMs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Domestic NOTAMs, commonly referred to as NOTAM D, report changes of navaid status, runway conditions, airspace, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and other information essential for operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>FDC NOTAMs deal with regulatory information such as amendments to instrument approach procedures and other current aeronautical charts..</p> </li> <li> <p>International NOTAMs are issued for airports outside of the U.S. and are also available on the FAA’s NOTAM website and in several flight planning apps.</p> </li> <li> <p>Military NOTAMs, are intended for users of a military or joint-use facility and are published in the International NOTAM format.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id=reading-sectional-charts>Reading Sectional Charts<a class=headerlink href=#reading-sectional-charts title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 4</em></p> <p>Sectional charts provide visual navigation and basic airport information for pilots.</p> <h3 id=review_3>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_3 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The equator divides the globe into two equal parts, the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>2.    There are imaginary lines running parallel to the equator, called parallels of latitude.</p> <p>3.    Lines of longitude, known as meridians, cross the equator at 90 degree angles. Each meridian is drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole.</p> <p>4.    The zero longitudinal line, the prime meridian, passes through Greenwich, England. Longitudes to the east of Greenwich are east longitudes and vice-versa for the west.</p> <p>5.    We can locate a position where specific latitude and longitude lines converge. For example, Washington D.C. is located at the intersection of the 39 degree north latitude line and the 77 degree west longitude line.</p> <p>6.    On Sectional charts, the lines of latitude and longitude are shown and are sub-divided by tick marks. Each tick mark equals 1 minute. There are 60 minutes in each degree.</p> <p>7.    Using this information, Clermont County airport is located at 39 degrees, 4 minutes north latitude, and 84 degrees, 12 minutes west longitude.</p> <p>8.    Each minute of latitude is a nautical mile. By counting the tick marks on the longitude scale, you can measure distance. For example, the distance from Clermont County airport to Lunken airport is 10 nautical miles.</p> <p>9.    The only place where one minute of longitude equals one nautical mile is at the equator, because lines of longitude converge as they go north or south.</p> <p>10.  The Sectional chart has many symbols in its legend. Review these.</p> <p>11.  As a brief review consider the following: Control tower airports are in blue all others in magenta. With the airport's name, the coded data will tell you length of runway, pattern direction, contact information, airport elevation, lighting, and if it has automatic weather information.</p> <p>12.  Sectionals show surface elevation and obstructions, maximum elevation figures, roads, rivers, lakes, railroads, towns and much more.</p> <h2 id=understanding-time-zones>Understanding Time Zones<a class=headerlink href=#understanding-time-zones title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 5</em></p> <h3 id=review_4>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_4 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The earth turns one revolution of 360 degrees/day. One revolution takes 24 hours. Therefore the earth revolves at 15 degrees per hour.</p> <p>2.    For every 15 degrees of longitude there is normally a time zone change of one hour. The lower 48 states have four time zones; eastern, central, mountain, and pacific.</p> <p>3.    Aviation uses a 24 hour clock to avoid mistakes between a.m. or p.m. The 24 hour clock is often referred to as military time.</p> <p>4.    To further avoid time confusion, all world time is converted into the time that exists at Greenwich England at that moment. This time is called Greenwich Mean Time, Coordinated Universal Time, or ZULU time. At noon here in the EST zone, it is 6 p.m. in Greenwich, England. Therefore, using the 24 hour clock, it is 1800Z here.</p> <h2 id=air-facts-where-is-it-really>Air Facts: Where Is It, Really<a class=headerlink href=#air-facts-where-is-it-really title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 6</em></p> <p>It's possible to become disoriented when flying and not know precisely where you are. This often occurs when a person becomes fixated on one point and disregards all the other telling information.</p> <h3 id=review_5>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_5 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    For example; on a day, VFR flight, you might see a town, decide it's one of your checkpoints, and head for it only to find you're off course.</p> <p>2.    This can more easily happen at night. You see an airport beacon and decide that's your airport.</p> <p>3.    Your first impression may be wrong – keep double checking.</p> <p>4.    Practice estimating distance from the airplane. It's not always easy to do. A lot depends on the visibility and your altitude.</p> <p>5.    Inadequate planning, or improper execution of the plan, can also lead to confusion.</p> <p>6.    Usually, your disorientation is short lived. By a complete review of all the factors and your Sectional, the problem will be quickly solved.</p> <h2 id=sportys-e6b-flight-planning-and-test-prep>Sporty’s E6B: Flight Planning and Test Prep<a class=headerlink href=#sportys-e6b-flight-planning-and-test-prep title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 7</em></p> <p>In this section, we'll explore how to use Sporty's E6B flight computer, including the specifics of how to use each function required for flight planning and to answer questions on the FAA knowledge test.</p> <h3 id=review_6>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_6 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The E6B calculator is considered required equipment by most pilots. During flight training, you’ll learn to plan your cross-country flights first by hand and use the E6B each step of the way.</p> <p>2.    Sporty's E6B is approved for use during the FAA knowledge test, and can make it easy to answer calculation questions.</p> <p>3.    The controls on the Sporty’s E6B are thoughtfully laid out and provide quick access to each of the aviation functions. These functions are organized into six groups and accessed by the buttons at the top of the keypad: Heading-groundspeed and Pressure-Density Altitude, Speed, Required, Wind, Flight, and Weight and Balance.</p> <p>4.    To use one of the functions, first press its respective group button, which will declutter the screen and only show the available functions that are a part of that group. Then use the up or down arrow on the right side of the screen to highlight the desired function, which will be flashing. Lastly, press the Enter key to start using the function.</p> <p>5.    The 20 conversion options are listed in yellow text above the gray arithmetic buttons on the E6B. To use one, enter a number on the screen, press the CONV button, and then the specific button with the conversion you'd like to execute.</p> <p>6.    You can use the standard arithmetic buttons at any time to perform basic math problems, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. The plus/minus key should be used when you need to make a number negative or positive. If a number is negative, a dash symbol will appear to the right of the number.</p> <p>7.    When entering time, first enter the hours, and then press the colon key. Next enter the minutes value and press the colon key again. Last enter the second.</p> <p>8.    While you can’t use it on the FAA knowledge test, Sporty’s also offers a mobile app version of the E6B for iPad, iPhone and Android devices. It includes the same aviation functions and conversions as the handheld version, but you’ll find it more convenient to access when away from your flight bag and if you’re already using a tablet in the cockpit.</p> <h2 id=flight-planning-part-1-plotting-a-course>Flight Planning Part 1: Plotting a Course<a class=headerlink href=#flight-planning-part-1-plotting-a-course title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 8</em></p> <p>In this section we will investigate the navigation planning that's done on the ground prior to a flight. It's one of the key elements of proper preflight preparation.</p> <h3 id=review_7>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_7 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    To do this, we'll use pilotage, dead reckoning, and radio navigation.</p> <p>2.    Pilotage is looking out the airplane window and flying along the course by reference to pre-selected landmarks until reaching the destination.</p> <p>3.    Dead reckoning, is calculating the effect of the wind direction and speed on the airplane so a compass heading, groundspeed, time en route, and fuel required can be estimated.</p> <p>4.    Radio navigation is using an instrument to help stay on the desired course – VOR or GPS as an example.</p> <p>5.    A plotter is a device for measuring distance and direction. Some plotters have a sectional scale on one side and a world aeronautical chart scale on the other – take care to use the correct side.</p> <p>6.    After measuring the distance for the trip, determine the directions of each leg. You do this with the protractor part of your plotter. This is the true course.</p> <p>7.    NOTE: If a course line is long and crosses numerous meridians, measure the course on one of the meridians closest to the center.</p> <p>8.    Wind information is next applied. Wind information received over the radio for takeoffs or landings is given as a magnetic direction. All other wind information spoken or printed is given in true direction.</p> <p>9.    The airplane's path over the ground is called track. The direction the nose of the airplane is pointing is called heading. Because of the wind, we adjust the heading to get the desired track over the ground.</p> <p>10.  The angle formed between the heading and the course is called the wind correction angle.</p> <p>11.  Wind speed must be known for an accurate solution – it affects groundspeed. If you fly at 100 knots east in a no wind condition, your groundspeed is 100 knots. If there is a 10 knot headwind from the east your groundspeed will be 90 knots.</p> <p>12.  Groundspeed is a combination of the movement of the airplane with the movement of the air.</p> <p>13.  The magnetic compass is not dependent on any power source in the airplane. However, it has some peculiarities – magnetic variation and compass deviation.</p> <p>14.  Variation is the angle between true north and magnetic north at any given location. On sectional charts, the amount and direction of variation, are shown by broken magenta lines called isogonic lines.</p> <p>15.  The line with zero variation between true north and magnetic north is called the agonic line.</p> <p>16.  On the east coast the magnetic compass needle will point to the west of true north. On the west coast the needle will point to the east of true north.</p> <p>17.  Your actual course has to take into consideration magnetic variation. This is done by adding or subtracting variation to your course as shown by the nearest isogonic line on the chart. For example, if your true course is 50 degrees, and the nearest isogonic line is 5 degrees west, then you would fly a course of 55 degrees. Remember, west is best, east is least.</p> <p>18.  Deviation is the deflection of the magnetic compass from its normal reading caused by some magnetic influence in the airplane. To make this correction the airplane must have a compass correction card. It shows any addition or subtraction necessary to correct for various headings.</p> <p>19.  After measuring true course and applying the wind correction, a true heading can be determined. Next, apply variation to get the magnetic heading. Finally, correct for deviation and you arrive at a compass heading. You fly a compass heading.</p> <p>20.  Before you fly you want to determine the estimated time en route, groundspeed, and how much fuel will be required.</p> <p>21.  Normally you will make these determinations by using an electronic flight computer.</p> <p>22.  Other information for the trip is found in your pilot's operating handbook.</p> <p>23.  To calculate the dead reckoning information, you need to determine true airspeed. Use the graphs or tables in the performance section of your pilot's operating handbook to do this. Select the cruise performance that best fits your needs at your selected altitude.</p> <p>24.  When computing time from point to point, don't forget to add 5 minutes for climb, descent, pattern, and taxi.</p> <p>25.  The FARs require that day VFR flights must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p>26.  It's also a good idea to check the Airport/Facility Directory for fuel availability at your destination airports if more is needed for any reason.</p> <p>27.  Now select your checkpoints. Make them close enough together so they are easy to find in a reasonable amount of time.</p> <p>28.  On a trip you can use radio navigation to help pinpoint your location – VOR, ADF, GPS.</p> <p>29.  A long trip is divided into a succession of short trips – from one checkpoint to the next.</p> <h2 id=flight-planning-part-2-preparing-a-navlog>Flight Planning Part 2: Preparing a Navlog<a class=headerlink href=#flight-planning-part-2-preparing-a-navlog title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 9</p> <p>In this section we’ll continue the dead reckoning planning process and determine the time en route, groundspeed and how much fuel will be required. We’ll also select visual landmarks to use for pilotage during the flight, and wrap up by entering all the calculations in a flight log.</p> <p>Review:</p> <p>1.    Before you fly you want to determine the estimated time en route, groundspeed, and how much fuel will be required.</p> <p>2.    Normally you will make these determinations by using an electronic flight computer.</p> <p>3.    First select your visual checkpoints from the sectional chart. Make them close enough together so they are easy to find in a reasonable amount of time.</p> <p>4.    It can be helpful to plan the first checkpoint near the planned top of climb.</p> <p>5.    Take note of the airports along the route in case a diversion to one is required.</p> <p>6.    Enter the name of each checkpoint on the left side of the flight planning form.</p> <p>7.    To calculate the dead reckoning information, you need to determine true airspeed. Use the graphs or tables in the performance section of your pilot's operating handbook to do this. Select the cruise performance that best fits your needs at your selected altitude.</p> <p>8.    We’d also recommend determining the time, fuel and distance to climb to the cruise altitude, which can be found in your airplane’s climb performance chart.</p> <p>9.    Calculate the flight details for each leg using the Heading and Groundspeed function on the E6B, which will allow you to calculate a true heading and groundspeed.</p> <p>10.  Use a plotter to measure the distance between each visual checkpoint, use the E6B to calculate leg time and fuel burn.</p> <p>11.  Calculate these planning values for each of the remaining segments and enter the sum for distance, time and fuel at the bottom of the form. Complete additional forms for any subsequent legs to compute the total time and fuel burn for your flight.</p> <p>12.  The FARs require that day VFR flights must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p>13.  A long trip is divided into a succession of short trips – from one checkpoint to the next.</p> <h2 id=cross-country-planning-with-ipad>Cross-country planning with iPad<a class=headerlink href=#cross-country-planning-with-ipad title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 10</em></p> <p>In this section we'll show how to plan a cross-country flight using ForeFlight's digital sectional chart and performance planning resources.</p> <h3 id=review_8>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_8 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    You’ll likely learn to plan a trip first with a paper sectional chart, plotter and E6B, and complete a paper navigation log with all the details of the flight.</p> <p>2.    Another method is to use an electronic resource, like ForeFlight on an iPad, to assist with the planning process.

Use Climb performance data from your airplane’s flight manual to find the numbers for the climb section, and the Cruise Performance chart to determine True Airspeed and the fuel burn rate.</p> <p>4.    Next, enter your departure and destination airport on the maps screen.</p> <p>5.    Now it's time to choose a cruise altitude. Use the altitude button to display the Altitude advisor window, which shows headwind/tailwind components, estimated time en route and fuel burn for each altitude.</p> <p>6.    To assist with pilotage and dead reckoning, select checkpoints/landmarks on the chart.

Navigation systems include any method a pilot uses to follow a predetermined flight path over the earth's surface. One common radio navigation receiver is the VOR.</p> <h3 id=review_10>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_10 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range, abbreviated VOR, is the primary navigation system for civil aviation.</p> <p>2.    Most VOR sites have an operating TACAN (the military version) attached to them. The combination of the two stations is called a VORTAC. A VORTAC has two distinctly different transmitters and antenna systems at the same site.</p> <p>3.    The VOR station is a small low building topped with a flat white disc which houses an antenna system.</p> <p>4.    On the Sectional chart, the frequency for the VOR is shown in a box near the station symbol.</p> <p>5.    A compass rose is centered on the VOR symbol. The compass rose and the VOR are aligned with magnetic north. Everything else on the Sectional is oriented to true north.</p> <p>6.    There are 360 different courses – radials – radiating from a VOR – something like the spokes on a bicycle wheel. Radials are defined as magnetic courses from a VOR.</p> <p>7.    VOR signal reception is line of sight and varies according to the altitude of your airplane. Obstructions can block a VOR signal.</p> <p>8.    Normal VOR reception extends out approximately 40 nautical miles from the station.</p> <p>9.    A VOR is identified by a three letter Morse code. Identifying the station is extremely important. Be sure the correct station is tuned in and the station is operating.</p> <p>10.  The VOR receiver has a volume control, ident switch, and frequency selector.</p> <p>11.  Pulling the ident switch allows you to hear the Morse code identification. With the switch pushed in, the Morse tones are suppressed, making it easier to hear voice transmissions.</p> <p>12.  The VOR indicator has an Omni Bearing Selector, OBS, a Course Deviation Indicator, CDI, and a TO/FROM indicator.</p> <p>13.  The Omni Bearing Selector is used to select the bearing, or course. When a course is selected, the course deviation indicator shows the position of the selected course.</p> <p>14.  The CDI and the TO/FROM indicator are not affected by the heading of the airplane. At any location, if the CDI indicates the selected course is to the left, the CDI will remain pointing to the left no matter which way the airplane is pointed.</p> <p>15.  If the needle is centered, the airplane is on a specific radial. You can read that course on the OBS. If, after setting the desired course into the OBS, the CDI is pointed to the right, the selected course is to the right. A needle to the left means the course is to the left. In both instances however, the airplane must be heading in the correct direction.</p> <p>16.  A full scale deflection of the CDI represents 10 degrees. How far off course you are depends on your distance from the station. For example, a 5 degree deviation, 10 miles from the station, puts you about a mile off course. Thirty miles from the station, the same deviation puts you about 3 miles off course.</p> <p>17.  The TO/FROM indicator shows whether the selected course will take the airplane to, or from the station. For example, from the north, on the 360 degree radial, a bearing of 180 degrees "TO" will take the airplane on a course to the station. The same course from the south will take the airplane from the station.</p> <p>18.  To use the VOR to find your position, tune it to a nearby VOR station. Turn the OBS to center the CDI. Read the course from the OBS, and TO or FROM on the TO/FROM indicator. Now you can draw a line from the VOR. You know that you're located somewhere on that line.</p> <p>19.  To find your position on the line, look for a landmark, or find your position in relation to another VOR.</p> <p>20.  As you get closer to the VOR station, the heading corrections will become smaller because radials, like the spokes of a wheel, converge at the station.</p> <p>21.  Within a few miles of the station you'll notice the CDI and the TO/FROM indicator flickering. The size of this cone of confusion is relatively small at low altitudes and increases with altitude. This flickering is not station passage. Station passage is indicated when the TO/FROM indicator makes the first complete reversal to a FROM indication.</p> <p>22.  As you approach the VOR station, make small corrections to keep the CDI centered.</p> <p>23.  A VORTAC, a VOR station in combination with a TACAN, has distance measuring capability – DME. Some DMEs show groundspeed and time to the station as well.</p> <p>24.  A VOR receiver, used for instrument flight, must have been operationally checked for accuracy within the past 30 days.</p> <p>25.  The Airport/Facility Directory lists designated ground and airborne receiver checkpoints. At these locations, a specified radial should be received. For IFR, the ground check error cannot exceed 4 degrees. Maximum error using the designated airborne check is 6 degrees.</p> <p>26.  Another way to check the VOR is the VOT. VOTs transmit the 360 degree radial in all directions. No matter where the aircraft is located, the VOR receiver will indicate the 360 degree radial. Electronically, the aircraft is always located north of the VOT. For IFR flight, the CDI must center within 4 degrees of 360 degrees FROM, or 180 degrees TO.</p> <h2 id=global-positioning-system-gps>Global Positioning System (GPS)<a class=headerlink href=#global-positioning-system-gps title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 13</em></p> <p>GPS stands for global positioning system.

This knowledge is important for your planning and flying safety.</p> <h3 id=review_14>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_14 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Air masses are defined as large bodies of air in which the temperature and humidity are fairly uniform. Air masses are created whenever a large body of air approaches and remains at a source region.</p> <p>2.    An air mass is created whenever air remains in a region long enough to acquire the temperature and moisture characteristics of the surface.</p> <p>3.    When conflicting air masses meet, the differences of temperature and moisture are greatest at the ground and at lower altitudes. The weather which results from this conflict is also most intense at lower altitudes and tends to diminish higher up.</p> <p>4.    The best source regions are large snow and ice covered Polar Regions, cold northern oceans, tropical oceans, and large desert areas.</p> <p>5.    Air masses are identified using three letters. The first lower case letter identifies the surface of the source region, C for continental and M for maritime or a water surface. Source region is indicated by an upper case letter, P for polar, A for arctic, T for tropical and E for equatorial.</p> <p>6.    The last letter is lower case, W for an air mass warmer and K for an air mass colder than the surface over which it is moving.</p> <p>7.    A W air mass is cooled from below which implies stable conditions with smooth flying, stratus clouds, fog, and poor visibility. Precipitation, if any, would be widespread drizzle and rain.</p> <p>8.    The K air mass indicates heating air from below and therefore unstable conditions. With unstable conditions pilots can expect rough air to 10,000 feet or so, cumuliform clouds, and if there is precipitation, it is localized or showery.</p> <p>9.    The zone between contrasting air masses is called a front. All fronts are in troughs which extend from lows.</p> <p>10.  Air masses are highs meaning the air pressure within the air mass is higher than the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The lowest pressure in each air mass is found at the boundary between them – the front.</p> <p>11.  The position of a front aloft is just as important as its surface position. A frontal slope can be as steep as 1 to 50 and as shallow as 1 to 300. An airplane 1 mile above the surface could cross the frontal zone in as little as fifty miles from the surface position, or may have to fly as many as 300 miles beyond the surface position of the front.</p> <p>12.  When moving across a front, the change of temperature, wind, and humidity may be quite abrupt or very gradual depending on the properties of each air mass. Winds always change direction when you cross a front.</p> <p>13.  Air should flow directly from high to low pressure, down the pressure gradient, but air flow is modified by the Coriolis Effect which is caused by the earth's rotation.</p> <p>14.  The wind is deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere. Around a low, the flow is counter clockwise or cyclonic. Flow around a high is clockwise or anticyclonic.</p> <p>15.  When crossing the front the change in wind direction calls for a heading change to the right in order to maintain course. A heading change to the right is needed when crossing any front in any direction.</p> <p>16.  There is a difference in the rate of pressure change across a front. Make sure to keep your altimeter settings current.</p> <p>17.  The kind of weather you'll encounter in a front depends on the moisture available, stability of the air that is being lifted, speed of movement, frontal slope, and upper wind flow.</p> <p>18.  Fronts can be classified as cold, warm, stationary, and occluded.</p> <p>19.  When cold air advances and replaces warmer air the leading edge of the cold air is called a cold front. The chart symbol for the cold front is a line with triangles pointing in the direction of movement.</p> <p>20.  Cold fronts typically move toward the southeast at speeds of 25 to 30 knots. They frequently produce thunderstorms at the surface position of the front and lines of thunderstorms, called squall lines, a hundred miles or so ahead of the front.</p> <p>21.  If warm air is advancing, replacing colder air, the leading edge of the warm air is called a warm front. Warm fronts are charted as half circles on a line pointing in the direction of movement.</p> <p>22.  Because warm fronts have a shallower slope, warm frontal weather is usually found over a much wider band than cold front weather.</p> <p>23.  If the warm air is unstable there may be thunderstorms embedded in the massive layers of stratus clouds.</p> <p>24.  If a front is not moving it's called a stationary front. The cold and warm front symbols are alternated to indicate a stationary front – pointing in opposite directions.</p> <p>25.  Low ceilings, visibilities, and the weather associated with the stationary front may affect an area for several days.</p> <p>26.  An occluded front is symbolized by warm and cold front symbols on the same side of the line indicating the direction of movement. It's long lived and can cause violent weather. The warm front moving northward is followed by a cold front which moves faster catching up with the warm front – pushing air upward which tends to build towering cumulus clouds.</p> <p>27.  Weather associated with the occluded front is a combination of warm and cold front weather. The worst weather associated with an occlusion is normally in the northeast portion of the occlusion.</p> <p>28.  Occasionally a non frontal low forms just downwind of mountain ranges and can be quite a weather maker. Upslope winds from across the plains can lead to low ceilings and visibilities, drizzle, fog, snow, and ice.</p> <p>29.  Be wary of the lee-slopes low. Rapidly changing weather can cause a pleasant clear sky flight to turn into a desperate search for the nearest airport, especially in winter.</p> <p>30.  Squall lines are lines of thunderstorms that form along lines of instability. While not directly associated with fronts, squall lines tend to form 50 to 100 miles ahead of and parallel to a cold front. Squall lines are indicated on a weather map by a line drawn with two dots alternating with a long dash.</p> <p>31.  Frontal weather can change very rapidly. The cold front which only has cloudiness in the morning may have a strong squall line forecast for the afternoon. The warm front which causes partly cloudy skies in the afternoon may bring fog, drizzle, and low clouds by nightfall.</p> <p>32.  To ensure a safe flight, get a good preflight weather briefing. Don't forget to check out the TAFs, and METARs. Keep a close look at the weather when in-flight.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-weather-information>Closer Look: Weather Information<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-weather-information title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 17</em></p> <p>In this section, we'll take a look at resources available for obtaining preflight weather information.</p> <h3 id=review_15>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_15 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    While you always have the option to call Flight Service for a preflight weather briefing, you may find that looking at the weather data and imagery yourself can help provide a more complete picture of the weather before a flight.</p> <p>2.    The Lockheed Martin Flight Service website provides a good alternative to the phone weather briefing at 1800WXBRIEF.com.</p> <p>3.    If you’re looking to view just a few text weather reports or forecast charts, another free online resource is AviationWeather.gov.</p> <p>4.    There are also dedicated mobile apps available for phones and tablets that provide a complete source of preflight weather for pilots.</p> <p>5.    When you get to the airport, you may find a computer dedicated to displaying aviation weather. The most common provider is WSI</p> <h2 id=weather-forecasts-and-pireps>Weather Forecasts and PIREPs<a class=headerlink href=#weather-forecasts-and-pireps title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 18</em></p> <p>In this section, we'll take a look at Prog Charts and PIREPs.</p> <h3 id=review_16>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_16 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Low-level significant weather prognostic charts (Prog Charts) are general visual weather forecasts designed for flight planning up to 24,000 feet. They provide a visual depiction of predicted weather.</p> <p>2.    There are four panels on the Prog Chart. The top panels forecast the weather conditions between the surface and approximately 24,000 feet. Weather conditions at the surface are forecast by the bottom charts. The left hand panels are 12 hour progs, and the right hand panels are 24 hour progs.</p> <p>3.    In general, the 24 hour panels tend to be less reliable than the 12 hour panels. To determine expected conditions beyond the valid time of the 12 hour prog it is necessary to interpolate between it and the 24 hour prog.</p> <p>4.    The surface prog outlines areas of forecast precipitation and thunderstorms. A forecast of the type of precipitation and amount of coverage is also shown.</p> <p>5.    Forecast areas of IFR and marginal VFR are indicated on the top two panels. The bases and tops of moderate or greater turbulence as well as freezing levels are also shown. The common standard weather symbols used on the prog are intermittent rain, drizzle, and snow.</p> <p>6.    Review the symbology for the Prog Chart.</p> <p>7.    Practice reading and interpreting both the Prog Chart.</p> <p>8.    Pilot Reports (PIREPs) give recent airborne information about cloud tops, icing, and turbulence. They are the only means of obtaining certain critical information for briefers and for forecasters.</p> <p>9.    PIREPs give the location of the report, time, altitude, aircraft type, and weather reported.</p> <p>10.  Depending on the reporting source, the information may or may not be useful. For example: moderate turbulence reported by a Cessna 172 at 3000 feet would not be of much use to a 747 captain. However, a 172 pilot should be very interested in moderate turbulence reported by a 747 crew at 3000 feet.</p> <p>11.  Pilots are requested to report anything observed that may be of concern to other pilots.</p> <h2 id=closer-look-tablets-in-the-cockpit>Closer Look: Tablets in the Cockpit<a class=headerlink href=#closer-look-tablets-in-the-cockpit title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 19</em></p> <p>Today, pilots are using tablets to assist with just about every aspect of flying.

And don’t forget you have to do it by hand on the knowledge test.</p> <p>2.    Most of the aviation apps available today include electronic versions of all the VFR Sectional and Terminal Area Charts, meaning you won’t be required to carry paper sectionals or A/FDs for navigation and airport info if you go that route. And best of all, when using your tablet with a GPS source you’ll see your airplane’s position right on the chart.</p> <p>3.    Become familiar with Advisory Circular 91-78. The AC provides guidance to pilots using EFBs to replace paper charts in the cockpit. This AC says that it’s ok to substitute electronic charts for paper in flight, but you must adhere to the following guidelines. First you’ll need an application that displays the charts on the tablet, and the charts and data must be kept current. New data and chart updates are available for download every 28 days right in your aviation application.</p> <p>4.    AC 91-78 recommends bringing along a backup source, such as a paper chart or second EFB, but this is not mandatory.</p> <p>5.    Consider how to secure the tablet in a way that allows for easy operation during all phases of flight, and to make sure it doesn’t fall out of reach when flying through rough air.</p> <h2 id=the-dual-cross-country-flight>The Dual Cross Country Flight<a class=headerlink href=#the-dual-cross-country-flight title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 20</em></p> <p>In this section, we'll take a look at cross-country flying.</p> <h3 id=review_18>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_18 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    The weather is checked and your flight log is filled out.

So, begin a descent in plenty of time.</p> <p>12.  Don't forget the before landing checklist. Log your time of arrival and keep scanning.</p> <p>13.  You will either land or possibly make a touch and go to start on the next leg of your trip.</p> <p>14.  If you are using radio navigation, for example VOR, you will want to set it up either prior to takeoff or in the air. It works well as a help to stay on course or to find your precise location with cross reference.</p> <p>15.  Identifying a runway can be simple. Runway numbers are aligned in a magnetic direction. There are compass roses on the chart around any VOR which are also aligned in a magnetic direction.</p> <p>16.  Flying cross-country is a lot of fun. There's a lot to do to keep you busy. Remember to keep scanning, follow the checklists, and adhere to the procedures.</p> <h2 id=vfr-flight-following>VFR Flight Following<a class=headerlink href=#vfr-flight-following title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 21</em></p> <p>While flying VFR, it can be useful to have an extra set of eyes on your flight. Radar flight following can be a valuable resource.</p> <h3 id=review_19>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_19 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Flight following is an optional service in Class E airspace provided by ATC to VFR aircraft on a workload permitting basis.</p> <p>2.    When taking part in flight following, the VFR aircraft is radar identified and in communication with a controller. This allows the controller to provide traffic advisories and other assistance to the aircraft.</p> <p>3.    The controller gets a confirmation of the aircraft's identity, route of flight, and altitude.</p> <p>4.    Primary navigation along with "see and avoid" responsibilities remain with the VFR pilot.</p> <p>5.    Flight following may be requested from an air route traffic control center or from a terminal radar approach control facility.</p> <p>6.    ARTCC or "center" frequencies may be found in the AFD. Tracon or "approach" frequencies may be found on the sectional chart and in the AFD.</p> <p>7.    If you need to leave the frequency for a few minutes to update weather, simply advise the controller of this.</p> <p>8.    If you are listening to another frequency to obtain updated weather or for other reasons, listen carefully to both frequencies, giving ATC's frequency the priority.</p> <p>9.    At times, ATC will coordinate your flight following with the next sector and hand you off to a controller on another frequency. At other times, the controller's workload may not allow this direct handoff.</p> <p>10.  As a VFR pilot, you may also cancel the flight following yourself.</p> <h2 id=normal-airspace>Normal Airspace<a class=headerlink href=#normal-airspace title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 22</em></p> <p>Understanding the airspace system is easy once you grasp this concept: the designation of a parcel of airspace is driven by what goes on there.</p> <h3 id=review_20>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_20 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    In much of the U.S. there is no need for a lot of restrictions. More control, however, is needed around an airport where airlines are coming and going frequently.</p> <p>2.    The International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, classifies airspace by the letters A through G, A being the most restrictive, G having the fewest constraints placed on it. There is no class F airspace in the United States.</p> <p>3.    There is also special use and other airspace.</p> <p>4.    Class A airspace which starts at eighteen thousand feet MSL and extends up to and including flight level six zero zero. Class A airspace is not depicted on charts.</p> <p>5.    Flight level altitudes are expressed in hundreds of feet. For example, flight level 350 is a pressure altitude of 35,000 feet.</p> <p>6.    All operations in Class A must be conducted under instrument flight rules – you can't fly at and above 18,000 feet VFR. You must be instrument rated and equipped, obtain an ATC clearance before entering class A, and maintain two-way radio contact with ATC while operating in Class A.</p> <p>7.    Class B airspace is located around airports where there's a large volume of air traffic.</p> <p>8.    Class B airspace is depicted as an upside down wedding cake in shape. It begins at the surface and extends upward to a designated altitude.</p> <p>9.    Aircraft inside Class B can fly at two hundred and fifty knots. Aircraft operating below the overhanging layers of the Class B airspace are limited to two hundred knots.</p> <p>10.  Before operating in Class B, you must receive authorization from ATC, maintain two-way radio communications, and have an operating transponder with altitude reporting.</p> <p>11.  Private pilots may operate in Class B. Student pilots cannot takeoff, land, or fly solo in that airspace unless they have received ground and flight instruction for the specific Class B airspace. The student's logbook must have been endorsed within the previous 90 days by the instructor who gave the flight instruction. Recreational pilots may fly in Class B airspace after receiving an endorsement for ATC communication.</p> <p>12.  The minimum VFR visibility in Class B is 3 statute miles and you must stay clear of clouds. Class B airspace is shown on World Aeronautical, Terminal Area, and Sectional charts.</p> <p>13.  Flying over or under the Class B area and within thirty nautical miles of the primary airport, the aircraft must have an operating transponder and altitude reporting capability.</p> <p>14.  Class C airspace surrounds airports handling a moderate volume of air traffic and resembles a two- layer, upside-down wedding cake in shape. It typically extends 4,000 feet above the surface.</p> <p>15.  To operate in Class C, you'll need to establish communications with ATC, and hold at least a student pilot certificate. A transponder with altitude reporting is required within and above Class C airspace.</p> <p>16.  For VFR flight, a minimum visibility of 3 statute miles is required and you must remain 500 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 2,000 feet laterally away from clouds. Class C airspace is on Terminal Area, Sectional, World Aeronautical, and low altitude en route charts.</p> <p>17.  It's depicted by solid magenta circles on VFR charts.</p> <p>18.  In Class C and Class D unless otherwise authorized, you may not exceed two hundred knots within four nautical miles of the primary airport at or below 2,500 feet.</p> <p>19.  Class D airspace surrounds tower controlled airports that do not have an associated Class B or C area. You must establish two way radio communications with ATC before operating in Class D airspace, and you must possess a minimum of a student certificate.</p> <p>20.  Class D airspace is depicted on VFR charts with a segmented blue line. Many have arrival extensions, giving the airspace the shape of a keyhole. The actual vertical boundary is charted inside a blue segmented box in hundreds of feet MSL. VFR traffic advisories from ATC are provided on a workload permitting basis.</p> <p>21.  Class E airspace is controlled airspace that is not included in classes A, B, C or D and extends upward from the surface or up from a floor of either 700 or 1200 feet AGL in most other areas. It extends up to, but not including, 18,000 feet unless there is an overlying B or C airspace.</p> <p>22.  Radio contact is not required to fly VFR in Class E airspace.</p> <p>23.  Cloud clearances in Class E below 10,000 feet are, 500 feet below, 1,000 feet above and 2,000 feet horizontally from clouds and 3 miles visibility. At and above 10,000 feet and more than 1200 feet AGL, this increases to five miles visibility and cloud clearances of a thousand feet above and below and one statute mile horizontally.</p> <p>24.  To takeoff, land, or enter the traffic pattern at an airport in Class E airspace, you must have a minimum ceiling of 1,000 feet and a minimum visibility of 3 miles.</p> <p>25.  Special VFR allows VFR flight to and from airports in controlled airspace with a minimum visibility of one mile and still remaining clear of clouds. It must be requested by the pilot.</p> <p>26.  To fly special VFR at night, you must be instrument rated.</p> <p>27.  Check your Sectional for the many ways that Class E airspace is depicted.</p> <p>28.  Federal airways are designated routes between navigational facilities.</p> <p>29.  Class E airspace begins again above flight level 600 with no upper limit.</p> <p>30.  Class G airspace is referred to as uncontrolled airspace. The rules for operating in Class G are simple, you don't have to talk to anybody or get permission to be there.</p> <p>31.  You do need certain visibility and cloud clearances, though, which vary by altitude and whether it's day or night. Review these requirements.</p> <p>32.  The terminal radar service area (TRSA) is depicted on VFR charts with grey rings. There are only a few TRSAs left.</p> <h2 id=special-use-airspace>Special Use Airspace<a class=headerlink href=#special-use-airspace title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 23</em></p> <p>Special use airspace consists of prohibited, restricted, warning, military operation, alert, and controlled firing areas. All these, except controlled firing areas, are charted on Terminal, Sectional, and World Aeronautical Charts.</p> <h3 id=review_21>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_21 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Prohibited areas specifically prohibit aircraft flight – period. It's important to check the NOTAMs if you'll be flying around these areas.</p> <p>2.    Restricted areas are defined as airspace where aircraft flight is subject to restrictions.</p> <p>3.    Warning areas are in international airspace. Activities in warning areas may be hazardous to non- participating aircraft. Warning areas cannot be designated restricted areas because they are over international waters.</p> <p>4.    Military operation areas (MOAs) are segments of airspace defined by vertical and lateral limits used to segregate military training activities from aircraft operating under IFR.</p> <p>5.    Most military training requires abrupt flight maneuvering. In an MOA, military pilots are exempted from FAA regulations prohibiting acrobatics in certain airspace and on federal airways.</p> <p>6.    Pilots of VFR aircraft should contact any flight service station within 100 miles of the MOA for real- time information about its current status.</p> <p>7.    Alert areas warn pilots of a high volume of pilot training or other unusual aerial activity. Pilots of participating and transit aircraft are equally responsible for collision avoidance.</p> <p>8.    Controlled firing areas have activities which, if not controlled, would be hazardous to non-participating aircraft.</p> <p>9.    Other airspace includes military training routes (MTRs) and airport advisory areas. An airport advisory area exists within 10 miles of an airport which does not have an operating control tower but does have a flight service station. The FSS provides traffic advisories to arriving and departing aircraft.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Military training routes are mutually developed by the FAA and the department of defense. They are generally established below 10,000 feet for operations at speeds above 250 knots.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pilots are not prohibited from flying in a military training route. However, pilots should be extremely vigilant when flying on, across, or near MTRs. You can check the status of an MTR by contacting a flight service station within 100 miles of the MTR.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) may be imposed to protect persons or property in the air and on the ground from an existing or imminent hazard on the surface.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, TFRs and limitations are implemented in areas visited or traveled by the President, Vice President or other public officials.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notification of TFRs or limitations is made by NOTAMs.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id=airspace-preflight-planning>Airspace Preflight Planning<a class=headerlink href=#airspace-preflight-planning title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 24</em></p> <p>VFR flight planning has come a long way since the days of folded paper charts, plotters and highlighters. In addition to providing full flight planning calculations, today’s online software and aviation apps, like ForeFlight, also provide interactive features to help plan optimum routing in and around controlled and special-use airspace.</p> <h3 id=review_22>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_22 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    Much like weather planning, it is always best to start with a big picture review of the airspace first, and then narrow down your focus to the details that apply to your planned route.</p> <p>2.    When using an EFB app, sectionals for the entire U.S are seamlessly stitched together, allowing you to plan a long cross-country flight and view all the information as if it were presented on one large VFR chart.</p> <p>3.    The VFR Flyway charts, which are printed on the back of the TAC chart in paper form, can also be displayed on the moving map by enabling that option from the Map layer menu.</p> <p>4.    ForeFlight includes several other airspace resources which can be found in the documents section of the app. Here you’ll find additional VFR planning resources, including Class B Enhancement graphics, VFR Flyway charts, chart legends and the Aeronautical Chart’s user’s guide.</p> <p>5.    ForeFlight includes a data-driven Aeronautical Map layer. This dynamic layer is scalable, interactive and can be customized to show only the details and chart features that matter to you.</p> <p>6.    The aeronautical layer is interactive, allowing you to tap on any element for additional information. Initially, you’ll see airspace type, altitudes and primary frequency, and then tap ‘more details’ if you’d like more information.</p> <p>7.    If you’re hesitant to make the switch to using ForeFlight’s aeronautical map layer over the traditional sectional, remember that you can choose to enable both layers on the map simultaneously from the layer menu.</p> <h2 id=wrap-up-going-places>Wrap Up - Going Places<a class=headerlink href=#wrap-up-going-places title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><em>Private Pilot Chapter 4 – Video Segment 25</em></p> <p>You have hit another milestone – you are piloting your airplane from place to place.</p> <h3 id=review_23>Review:<a class=headerlink href=#review_23 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>1.    If you don't learn something from each flight, you're not paying attention.</p> <p>2.    Log what you have learned and the circumstances surrounding that lesson in your logbook.</p> <p>3.    Learn from each flight.</p> <form class=md-feedback name=feedback hidden> <fieldset> <legend class=md-feedback__title> Was this page helpful? </legend> <div class=md-feedback__inner> <div class=md-feedback__list> <button class="md-feedback__icon md-icon" type=submit title="This page was helpful" data-md-value=1> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 12a8 8 0 0 0-8-8 8 8 0 0 0-8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8-8m2 0a10 10 0 0 1-10 10A10 10 0 0 1 2 12 10 10 0 0 1 12 2a10 10 0 0 1 10 10M10 9.5c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S7 10.3 7 9.5 7.7 8 8.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m7 0c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S14 10.3 14 9.5 14.7 8 15.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m-5 7.73c-1.75 0-3.29-.73-4.19-1.81L9.23 14c.45.72 1.52 1.23 2.77 1.23s2.32-.51 2.77-1.23l1.42 1.42c-.9 1.08-2.44 1.81-4.19 1.81"/></svg> </button> <button class="md-feedback__icon md-icon" type=submit title="This page could be improved" data-md-value=0> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 12a8 8 0 0 0-8-8 8 8 0 0 0-8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8-8m2 0a10 10 0 0 1-10 10A10 10 0 0 1 2 12 10 10 0 0 1 12 2a10 10 0 0 1 10 10m-6.5-4c.8 0 1.5.7 1.5 1.5s-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5-1.5-.7-1.5-1.5.7-1.5 1.5-1.5M10 9.5c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5S7 10.3 7 9.5 7.7 8 8.5 8s1.5.7 1.5 1.5m2 4.5c1.75 0 3.29.72 4.19 1.81l-1.42 1.42C14.32 16.5 13.25 16 12 16s-2.32.5-2.77 1.23l-1.42-1.42C8.71 14.72 10.25 14 12 14"/></svg> </button> </div> <div class=md-feedback__note> <div data-md-value=1 hidden> Thanks for your feedback! </div> <div data-md-value=0 hidden> Thanks for your feedback!
